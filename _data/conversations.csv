Roger,Bergmann,"Well, after I had gone into my first bar in 1981, in San Francisco, <b>I saw a flyer on the wall for the National Reno Gay Rodeo</b> which was the first gay rodeos that were held. They started in 1976, I believe it was, by a man named, Phil Ragsdale, in Reno, Nevada. And I went to the rodeo in August of 1981 shortly after I had gone into my first bar, because of the flyer that I had seen. So <b>there were about 8,000 people in the stands</b>.",getting-started
"Bruce 'Grumpy'",Roby,"I lived on the edge of West Hollywood and I had seen signs for this gay rodeo thing, and I'd seen them for 2 or 3 years. <b>But I thought, you know, pink pansies, purple horses. I don't know about this gay rodeo thing I grew up with real rodeo, I'm not interested.</b> Well, they got me to go with them <b>to the dance</b> at the Burbank Hilton on Friday night, 3,000 people at this dance, men women, and it's men, it's like regular guys ...they are just regular people that happen to be gay and <b>that's kind of where I really wanted to find life</b>. And I called in sick the next day and went to the rodeo, I called in sick the next day, and went back. It was like, I found a life.",getting-started
Candy,Pratt,"Well, I didn't know there was such a thing....When you grow up you hear of black rodeo or Indian rodeo or something like that. You know, you don't hear white rodeo, you know, it's just rodeo. So I just thought: 'Oh, my gosh!' I thought: <b>'Gay rodeo are you kidding?' So I went and I found out...</b>",getting-started
"'Paniolo' Joe",Rodriguez,"<b>It was a culture shock moving to San Francisco. The feeling to me was that I was not fitting in. I was lost in San Francisco.</b> I didn't identify with the Asian community and I didn't identify with the gay community. ...So I tried to fit in with the gay community but it still wasn't my crowd. <b> When I got to Sacramento and I saw cowboys and country western night dancing. </b> I mean, it was elbow to elbow. You couldn't dance on the dance floor at places. And the music was great. I knew the tunes. I knew the music. ...  </b> So then I thought: 'Wow! Gay community. Western lifestyle. I just fell into it. </b>",getting-started
Jack,Morgan,"<b>Well, the guys.</b> I mean, so obviously being a gay guy, right, I liked very masculine men and that was probably on it, honestly. That was one of the initial attractions. I was younger and I went to different types of environments and different types of bars, I just saw a lot of superficialness, maybe by their fault, or maybe by the environment. But what I found with Charlie's—and the country western lifestyle, IGRA, rodeo—<b>is that people seem to be a lot more genuine, a lot more caring, and just plain real. </b>",getting-started
David,Renier,"<b>I was in junior rodeo and high school rodeo</b> and then I went and did some open rodeos after high school. And then <b>a friend of mine told me about the gay rodeo</b> and I was 21 at the time and wasn't really sure. <b>I wasn't out at the time, </b> so I wasn't really sure I wanted to be part of it. It was in LA at the time and so I went down. I entered one event just to see if it was something I wanted to do. <b>I did my first event and was hooked.</b>",getting-started
Adam,Romanick,"So, I came out back in the late 90's early 2000's, and horses were always the center of my life, okay. Being with my horses, trail riding, showing, etcetera. And... one of the biggest challenges that I found with dating and everything is really trying to find someone, that shares that same love. So I met many people, dated people, been in a relationship with people that really didn't have that love, and it really was an issue, it really caused an issue. When you own horses, and a lot of horses, it takes hours, it takes money, it takes a lot of things, it's true dedication. Especially competing in the rodeos, its days of traveling, it's a lot of expense etcetera. With all of that, <b> I started to explore: how can I find someone that has, shares that same love? </b> ... And at that time, I really didn't get to know anything about the gay rodeo, just that it was out there. ... <b>I made it my goal to make sure that I was there [at the Philadelphia rodeo] in 2009, and that was the first rodeo I've ever competed in.</b>",getting-started
Lorrie,King,"My friend said, 'You know, there's this country western bar in town, would you be interested in learning dance, you know, country, line dance and country western couples dance?' And I said, 'Oh, that sounds like fun. I'll go with you.' So we started going there one day a week and taking lessons, learning to dance, and we met people. We had a lot of fun. And then he said, 'Did you know that there's a gay country western bar in town?' I said, 'No, never knew that.' ... So we started going there... And pretty soon he said, <b> 'Do you know there is such a thing of gay rodeo?'</b> And he knew I knew about rodeo, and I said, 'No, didn't know that either.' He said, 'Well there's going to be one in LA the next weekend. Would you be interested in going?' So I said, 'Okay, Sure. That'd be fun.' <b> So we went and it was so much fun and when I found out there was a charitable aspect that appealed to me and so, just sort of couple things happened at the same time. </b>",getting-started
