Frank,Harrell, The eye candy is terrific. ,special

David,Hallwood,"We may not see each other for six months to a year, but  it's just like old home week when you’re together. ",special

Danny,Lee,"They signed me up and [...] everyone’s all: 'Danny he's never done this before he has no idea what he's doing. He has no clue. He doesn't have any of the gear.'  And, you know, a jacket—protective jacket—appeared, helmet appeared.   A wig appeared [...]  suddenly there I was ready to do wild drag. ",special
Joe,Rodriguez,"I loved horses and always wanted to ride. […] Travis Gardner, was sort of my involuntary mentor.   He said, 'You want to ride broncs? Okay, let's get you suited up. Let’s get you strapped in. Let's get the rigs on. You don't have a rig? Okay, we'll borrow that guy's rig.'  So that was my first taste. ",special
Ann,Kinney,When I came off the bronc I actually landed on my shoulder and split my spleen in half. And got up and walked out of the arena. I didn't know that was internal bleeding. [...]  I don't break real easy so that's pretty good. ,injuries
David,Renier,"Oh yeah, I've had three reconstructive surgeries  on my knees, my arm, yeah, stuff like that.",injuries
Brian,Helander,"I did steer riding […] That was probably not so wise to do at age 40, because it wasn't the riding--it was the falling off and the hitting the ground.  And I broke my shoulder...",injuries
Joe,Rodriguez,My bareback bronc ride went wrong.  I got stuck in the rig and ended up underneath the horse and getting trampled.  They had to life flight me out of the rodeo...  Suffice to say I did not win the buckle that weekend. ,injuries

Bruce Grumpy,Roby,"I thought, you know, pink pansies, purple horses. I don't know about this gay rodeo thing I grew up with real rodeo, I'm not interested. Well, [my friends] got me to go with them [...]  It was like, I found a life. ",started
Candy,Pratt,"‘Oh, my gosh!’ I thought: ‘Gay rodeo are you kidding?’ So I went and I found out…",started
Paniolo Joe,Rodriguez," When I got to Sacramento and I saw cowboys and country western night dancing.  I mean, it was elbow to elbow. You couldn't dance on the dance floor at places. And the music was great. I knew the tunes. I knew the music. …   So then I thought: ‘Wow! Gay community. Western lifestyle. I just fell into it. ",started
Jack,Morgan,"Well, the guys. [...] But what I found with Charlie's—and the country western lifestyle, IGRA, rodeo—is that people seem to be a lot more genuine, a lot more caring, and just plain real. ",started
David,Renier," I wasn't out at the time,  so I wasn't really sure I wanted to be part of it. [...] I entered one event just to see if it was something I wanted to do. I did my first event and was hooked.",started

Adam ,Romanik,"Growing up my image of a cowboy was the guy out working the ranch, rounding up the cattle, and all that. And my image now has changed a lot…",cowperson

Brian ,Helander,"I came to Phoenix, Arizona and said, 'You know, you're in the southwest. What should your new identity be?' And it was like, 'Oh, you should be a cowboy, that's what we do in Arizona.' So, I set out to be a cowboy at age 40.",cowperson
Candy,Pratt,"Well, I can tell you anything about animals […] how to take care of them, what to do to them, I can rope, I can ride…",cowperson

Adam ,Romanik,Every part of my being is being involved with the horses and riding and living that cowboy lifestyle…,cowperson

David,Hallwood,"Oh, to myself, back when I was like sixteen. […] then I went through my “trying to straighten out my life” period, with the church and all that stuff. That didn't work. […] I actually got thrown out of the military because I was gay. Someone had turned me in...",comingout
Bruce,Roby,"I said, “You know, mom and dad, there is something we need to talk about, I'm gay. Dad said, “It doesn't matter, you are our son and we love you.” I'm like, “You've got to be shitting me. I've been holding on to this for twenty-five freaking years and that's the best you got. Oh my God.”",comingout
Roger,Bergmann,"My sister, no problem. My parents, really no problem. It stunned them, but there was no rejection. […] I feel really fortunate with the family that I have.",comingout
Lisa,Smith,"“Don't Ask, Don't Tell” was still in place. But still I had to watch what I was doing, or not doing, or whatever so I didn't get kicked out. I'd hate to get kicked out at the very end.",comingout
