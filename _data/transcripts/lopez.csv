,MC,"  Sonia, thank you so much for being with us and sharing your story with us. We are really honored and, um, delighted to have you be a part of the project. Um, you know, you saw the way this interview went; it’s kind of like as Mrs.— Doña— Maria Serrano said to us a few days ago, or, Doña Cuca actually said, “No más agárrale la cuerda y te vas con la historia.” So, that’s kind of how our, uh, if you can call it a methodology of oral history, that is what our methodology is. So, um, we can begin with your story anywhere you think is reasonable to begin, either in your ancient history of your family or your life growing up in, San Diego?",
,SL,  No. Imperial Valley. ,
,MC,"  Imperial Valley. So, why don’t, um, we’ll let you start where you are and then we’ll kind of go from there. ",
,SL,"  Okay, okay. I, um, I was born in Sonora, uh, México, uh, my family immigrated into the United States when I was a little girl and we, uh, settled in Imperial Valley. Um, if you’re familiar with the Imperial Valley it’s basically a farm, you know, it’s like the San Joaquin Valley. Um, the, the workers are the mexicanos and the, uh, landowners are the Anglo people. Um, my family, of course, came to the United States because of economics, like most immigrants that have come, you know, before us. And while growing up in Calexico I, I, I felt something was wrong but, you know, I didn’t have politics, I didn’t have analysis, I— we, the mexicanos were the majority, but, of course, there were no Mexican teachers, there were not, uh, Mexican elected officials, um, and that’s the way it was. Um, we ended up living in a really small town when we barely came to the United State; it’s Heber. Nobody knows where it is. Uh, I think it’s in the map now. Uh, very, very few families. Uh, and it’s almost like, uh, how shall I say, people live there— at least in my memory— now that I see some of the movies of the, uh, dustbowl, the way the people the people in Heber lived, uh, we lived in a house that did not have any, you know, it didn’t have a toilet. We had, you know, an outhouse in the back. ",
,SL,"  And growing up, we didn't think anything of it, uh, that that’s the way it was. Uh, I remember starting school and not knowing how to speak English and it, uh, it felt horrible. It felt horrible not to understand what was going on and being looked down upon by people, uh, mexicanos, Anglos, because some of the mexicanos, you know that had come before us; they already spoke English and we did not speak English. So, I remember this horrible feeling and Lind— uh, Rita was talking about feeling alienated and, and feeling isolated and I, I have those memories very vivid up to this date in my mind of how horrified I was going to school because we couldn't speak Spanish and we couldn’t, you know, be communicating with the teacher. Of course with the kids, but even with the kids you felt somewhat isolated, right, because they spoke some English and you didn’t. So, that was kind of awkward. ",
,SL,"  From Heber we moved up in the world and we went to Calexico and Calexico is like San Isidro is, uh, to Tijuana. Calexico is next to Mexicali. It’s a border town and you have 98% of the population is mexicano and, again, all the teachers are white. Everybody that ran the town was, you know, Anglo, and you knew there was a class difference but as a child or as growing up, you kinda was, you were okay with it because we were all mexicanos and the mexicanos that were doing better, they accepted us even though we were poor because we were brown like them, we spoke Spanish, you know, like them. But absolutely there was a class that you felt because, again, the Anglos, you know, they had the nice houses, they owned the businesses, they owned the farms, and you kind of grew up with it and just kind of accepted things as this is the way, you know, it was. ",
,SL,"  I ended up, um, in high school I was not a good student, um, I was uh, a chola, you could say. I was a chola. I ratted my hair, you know, I wore the outfit, um, but I was not really hardcore. Uh, I hung around with other young women who were, you know, they were hardcore because they would leave Calexico and follow the crops and, you know, go up north. So, you know, when they came back they had the hairdo, they had the dress and, of course, my family did not follow the crops so I ended up, you know, staying behind. I was fortunate enough that, um, I circulated with different crowds so that my tendencies to be a chola were overcome by, you know, uh, people that, “Hey, you know, let’s stay in school.” Uh, I guess because of the community that we were surrounded by, I think if I would have been in Fresno it would have been, you know, very different, but we were in Calexico and in Calexico you had the constant coming in of Mexican families to Calexico so the Mexican culture is very strong, the values are very strong, everybody knows everybody. So that’s almost like a, a culture check, so to speak. I happened to end up as a career counselor and what I— and I started, you know, trying to analyze why did I not end up, let’s say, going astray like some of the young people that I worked with and I go, “Well, maybe if we would have grown up here in Southeast San Diego, more separated from the border, it would have been, you know, a different story.” ",
,SL,"  But, anyway, by the time I ended up graduating from high school I decided that I wanted— I didn't want to be poor like my parents, and that’s what motivated me to decide to go to college. Uh, it was— being poor, you know, when people talk about it, a lot of times these days I feel people glamourize it, and, you know, there’s nothing glamorous about being poor. Uh, I remember, [starts to cry]…having to wear hand-me-down dresses that my mother would get from people and then I would run into people in school and they’d go, “Hey, you’re wearing my dress.” And that was, that was very hard. And, so, I think that living in poverty and knowing how much it hurts motivated me to say, “I don’t want to be poor. So, how do you figure out not being poor?” And, I didn’t have anybody tell me, “You need to go to school, you—” but I was fortunate enough that I had a friend of mine that her brother, her brother ended up going to Stanford, so that family stressed education. And, so, I think it was through that family that I got exposed to, you know, if you get an education and do something with your life, it’s a way out of poverty. And I think that was one of my main things that, uh, motivated me. ",
,SL,"  Um, growing up, um, my, my family was very traditional. Uh, I was brought up Catholic, uh, I was the oldest girl in the family, uh, uh, I had to take care of everything in the house. My mother started working because, of course, my dad ended up becoming a mechanic for a farm machinery, you know? Uh, Imperial Valley brings in farm machinery from all over the world and my dad was a very smart man, no education, and he figured out how to fix this machinery, so they would constantly be training him so he had like a permanent job, not a very good job but a permanent job, and then my mother started, you know, working in the local stores. And, so, when my mom started working, I don’t know, I must have been about ten years old, I had to start, you know, doing a lot of things because my mom wasn’t there. Um, so, I couldn't be a very good student because, you know, I had to come home, clean the house, make dinner, you know, I became the mom, you know, at a very young age.",
,SL,"  And, so, a lot of my friends began to do, like, better in school but I was okay with it, you know, it was like, “Okay.” I still didn’t figure out that I, I, I needed to get skills, I needed to go to college; I just kind of went along with the program. Um, in high school, during those times, you know, you’re talking about the sixties, uh, you know, the whole thing was to get a boyfriend and to get married. You know, that was— uh, a lot of my girlfriends were getting pregnant, uh, dropping out of school, uh, a lot of ‘em were getting married before they graduated from high school, and there was a group of us that I hung around with, I don’t know if because they were Holy Rollers or we were good girls or whatever, but, I happened to hang around with the girls that, uh, we didn’t have sex with the guys. Uh, it was like an unspoken value that we had even though young ladies around us were having sex and were getting pregnant. Anyway, we ended up surviving in terms of graduating from high school, uh, not getting pregnant, not having a baby, and, of course, really pushing the idea of getting married because that was, you know, that’s what you were supposed to do", as soon as you graduate you get married and you start a family. 
,SL,"  Somehow I, with the friends of mine, we ended up going to a community college and I think I started with a group of about ten or so of my friends and I think by the first semester most of them had dropped out. Uh, maybe by the second semester most of them had married, and I think of the crowd— I probably was the only one that was left that somehow I ended up finishing the community college because I had it in my mind that I was, you know, I wanted to be a teacher. And I think I wanted to be a teacher because I had had such a horrible experience in coming into the United States, uh, feeling, uh, it was like I felt I was an invisible child when I was in school. Uh, because I survived high school, I don’t know how I survived high school, I don’t even know how I survived the community college because I felt I didn’t have, you know, the skills, but I did. Anyway, I ended up coming into San Diego State through the EOP program. Uh I think at that time there was a man in Calexico, he was one of the— this is the time— this is in 1965, 1966— this is when you have the Civil Rights era beginning and you have, you know, Chávez beginning to come into the Imperial Valley, so you have a lot of political awakening of the mexicanos, of the mexicanos in the Imperial Valley and people in Calexico, in particular, started getting involved. And you have people like, uh, my girlfriend’s brother that had ended up in Stanford and you would get pieces here and there and somehow we ended up getting recruited by the EOP program at San Diego State.",
,SL,"  So, I ended up coming to San Diego State in 1968. Uh, and in 1968, I remember when I came to San Diego State, you know, I’d be walking on campus and there was, like, black people that were saying, “Join the Black Panthers,” and it was Civil Rights but it was a black. It was all about the black people in San Diego. Uh, I remember going— I was very interested, and at the same time, I didn’t think I was gonna survive San Diego State the first semester. I went through a complete culture shock. I mean, I just, like, uh, I, if I saw another mexicano I would walk to them and I would start speaking Spanish and the would look at me and I’m like, “You don’t speak Spanish?” And they’d go, “No, I don’t speak Spanish.” And to me that was, like, a shock. I had never been exposed to being on— I had really never left the Imperial Valley. I didn’t know what the world was about. I didn't know that you had mexicanos that didn’t speak Spanish. And, so, you know, it was like a shock. And I remember when I started looking for an apartment in San Diego, uh, one man asked me, he goes, “What are you?” And I go, “What do you mean what am I?” I go, “I’m Mexican.” And they go, “Oh, you don’t look like one of them.” And I go, “What do you mean ‘I don’t look like one of them?’” And they go, “Well, you don't have, you know, your eyebrows with a pencil and you don’t have your tattoos.” You know, so that was like some of the shock that I went [through]. And the other shocks that I went through is that I would walk into a classroom and there was, like, nobody that looked like myself. And I was, if you can believe it, I was the kind of person that if you looked at me, I would turn red. That was how quiet and shy I was. I mean, I was like—. ",
,SL,"  So, when I came to San Diego, I didn’t think I was gonna make it. I don’t know how I ended up— I think it must have taken me all day to register for classes. I didn’t know what I was registering for, um, with one of my roommates that I still talk to, you know, I talk to her and I go, “How did we get through? How did we get through?” Anyway, to make the long story short, after about— I would say, after the year was over, my first semester I got on academic probation. Uh, the second semester I didn’t know whether I was gonna make it, but I guess in my mind I knew that I was gonna make it. This is when I started— first semester I started getting involved with, you know, MEChA, you know, a lot of things that were going on at that time. Like I said, I was curious because you would walk through campus and it was about the black people and then chicanos had MAYA at that time and they started asking us to go to meetings and we started going, you know, we started listening and volunteering. But, of course, we were the nice, quiet, very conservative young ladies and, so, we were the ones that ended up taking the notes. “Oh, can you, can you make the calls?” “Yes, we can make the calls.” So we— because we were playing what was considered our roles. ",
,SL,"  Um, but at the same time this is when we started noticing a lot of the BS that was going on. Because you always had guys trying to hit you up, you know, especially like the older guys and we were— when I— I think it was the second year, the second year, ’69, that I was at State, we had, um, we had the CAMP program, uh, we had the PINTO program, you had all these, you know, men that had come out of prison, and they were like older than us. I mean, some of these guys were 25, they were 30. And these— you know, some of the guys that we were being exposed to that were involved with MEChA or what have you, and then you had the CAMP program, then you had the HEP program. The HEP program was the High School Equivalency Program and what they did was they brought in people that had dropped out of school, put them in the college, had them finish their high school, and transition them into the college. So, you know, you talk about a mix of people that were— we were all coming in from very different, you know, walks of life. I mean, I felt— it was funny because I could spot a chicana that came from LA in one minute. You know, she had the shoes, she had the dress, she had— you know? And at the meetings we used to have a lot— not competition but you know, the guys would salivate when they’d see these women, right? And we would call ‘em on it and they go, “Oh, just because you guys are jealous,” or, you know, we came— we were farm workers. ",
,"I mean, we were very poor. We couldn't afford what they could afford. Maybe, you know, in LA in the garment district you could have discounts or whatever, but we didn’t even go over there. So our— we dressed in our Levi’s, you know, our Levi's shirt, and that’s how we lived, that’s how we lived. But, yet, the women from LA, they were very different. They were very different, I mean, you know, they dyed their hair, they had the false eyelashes, I mean, you know, when they came to school you thought they were going to the prom or they were going to the dance or whatever. And like I said, it wasn’t about jealousy but just the differences were so, you know, obvious, you know you couldn’t help it. And, so, at meetings and things like that those were some of the things that, those politics, I think, used to come into the discussions without people even realizing it; because sometimes, like, the woman that was gonna go speak in front of everybody that got elected by the group was the one that, you know, had the real tight pants and looked very cutesy and all that. But at that time we couldn’t put our finger on it, you know, we couldn't really understand, you know, what was going on. ",,
,SL,"  Anyway, I ended up getting up very involved, uh, which was a blessing and it was a curse. It was a curse because I didn’t realize that I was going through this tremendous transition in my life and I had no control of it. I had no control of it, you know, it was happening and it was happening so fast that it happened and I didn’t realize that it had happened. Um, I had come to San Diego State with the focus that I was gonna come here, come a couple of years, become a teacher, get married, and go back to Calexico and help my family. My family was very poor. What ended up happening was I came to San Diego, I came to an environment that shocked me, that alienated me, that almost destroyed me, but I don’t know how and why it didn’t happen. I became what I felt was almost a political animal because I became the kind of person that I was in meetings 24 hours a day, uh, you know, I, I, I go to meetings, after I meeting I go to another meeting, uh, I go to school, uh, weekends, uh, I travel some place in the State of California. Uh, by my second year, by my second year, um, I knew that if I stayed in San Diego I would not graduate from college. ",
,"And, I saw the writing on the wall and I had connected with some people up in Sacramento. R","This is, this is, during this— I met Ana Nieto in ’68, I met Dorinda Moreno in ’68, uh, like I said, I was, along with Keta Chávez, uh, that’s what we did. We were in politics. Our whole life we were, you know, part of MEChA, uh, helped develop chicano studies, the Department of Chicano Studies, we had what is called a mesa directiva and the mesa directiva had, you know, MEChA representation, students representing MEChA, we had, uh, people representing the, uh, Mexican American Studies which is the, the chicana/chicano studies now, we had the Centro, uh, which was the library where people would check out books. We had developed some community programs and Escuelita had been started in the barrio. Um, the Barrio Station had been initiated, um, so somehow as women we didn’t think that we had to stay in our traditional role. Like I said, things happened so fast that we didn’t realize what was happening with us at that time. ",
,SL,"  Uh, we did talk a lot about being a part of the white women’s movement because everybody stayed away from that, like, big time. Nobody wanted to discuss what a feminist was, nobody wanted to talk about women’s liberation because that was, like, if you discussed that you’re not a real chicana, okay? And you’re a traitor, you’re a malinche, you know, all these— so we were becoming feminist but not saying that we were becoming feminist. We were becoming very political but we weren’t given the right or the space to say, “I’m a political chicana.” All we could say was, “I’m a chicana.” And a chicana meant being a hard stone nationalist. That’s what it meant. And being a hard stone nationalist meant that you had to be the mujer, the traditional role, you know, that catered to the men, that did what the men wanted, and if you didn’t, then you were..how shall— what did they brand us at that time? Ah, “vendida.” You were a vendida at that time. And if you, if you became, like, like with me I felt— I became— I got into the leadership; not really saying, “Hey, you know what? I’m gonna be a leader,” it just kind of happened. And then because I was outspoken, que no me dejaba, uh, you know, I was talking to— who was I talking to the other day? Oh, I was talking— no. A couple of years ago, maybe last year, I met up with Alurista and, you know, we were talking and he told me, “Well, how are you Sonia? Do you have children?” And I go, “Yeah, I have children,” and, you know, he looked surprised and I go, “Why are you surprised?” And he goes, “Well, I always thought you were a lesbian.” I go, “Oh, so, all the time that you knew me as a student back in the day you always thought—.” “Yeah,” he goes, “I assumed that you always were a lesbian.” And I go, “No, I wasn’t,” I go— but, you know, I had— I was involved with women that were gay because either they were my students or because they were my friends. ",
,SL,"  Uh, because at that time being— if you were gay, if you were a lesbian, especially a mexicana, of course you would not expose yourself because, I mean, even in the cultural sayings, right, uh, when you wanna put somebody down, when you want to put a man down you say, “Ay, pues parece maricón. Parece maricón,” you know? And in the slang Mexican culture a “maricón” is, you know, a man that’s gay. So, anything having to do with being gay or being lesbian in the Mexican culture is a put-down, and I happened— because of the person I was, I would have my students or my friends let me know that they were gay and I did see the pain and the sorrow that that caused. And, so, I always bonded or worked with, with a lot of women. ",
,SL,"  In 1970, in 1970 I ended up having— I made a conscious decision to leave San Diego. I made a conscious decision to leave San Diego because I knew that if I stayed here I would not graduate from— because my whole life was around my politics, and my schoolwork or being a student was secondary. Uh, at that time we were not only having MEChA meetings and organizing around different issues with MEChA, whether it was trying to get chicanos elected to the ASB because we had ne representation in the ASB, uh, or was it, uh, you know, working around— my brother was involved with some of the white radicals or some of the— some of the other leftist organizations on campus in getting a newspaper called Inside the Beast, uh, we had the newspaper, you know, La Verdad, we had people working on the boycott, uh, many of the people in MEChA were also working with the white radicals that were staging, like, sit-ins in the railroads where they were, you know, transporting the arms or bringing in the arms to ship ‘em off from here, from San Diego, to Vietnam. You know, we’re in a military town. So, being in San Diego was, how shall I say, very tough because this is a military town. This is a military town. And you felt the, uh, the scorn and you felt the discrimination in terms of either the boycott or just us forming a space at San Diego State. We were not able to get any monies from the ASB Council, from the University, unless we did it by force. We, we became— I mean, who would ever think that people like me would not be afraid to get arrested or have— be tear gassed. ",
,SL,"  You know, like, I keep saying it"," we were being transformed because of our environment, because we understood in a very, uh, closed way, because we still didn’t have, you know, the whole picture, uh, when we started coming together as students, faculty, administrators at San Diego State around ’68, ’69. Somebody was talking about having those meetings all day Saturday and all day Sunday,  and it was true, it was true. We would, you know, get up on a Saturday and we would come to somebody’s house like this and we sat around and we figured out what MEChA was gonna do for the next couple of months, what chicano studies was gonna be like, how we were gonna get money. You know, I mean we were planning and, and we— but at that time we were inspired that we were chicanos, we were mexicanos, we were— oh, I realised, “Hey, I’m okay. I’m okay. I can be proud that I’m a mexicana, but I’m not a mexicana.” I knew that because whenever I go to México, “You don’t speak good Spanish.” You know, “You can’t even pronounce your, your family’s last name correctly. You don’t know how to read. You don’t know how to write,” getting that discrimination. So I knew when I was growing up, yeah, I was a mexicana because my family told me, but I didn’t feel welcome, I didn’t feel wanted in the culture. And in the same token I didn’t feel wanted or welcome here and with the Chicano Movement, you know, that, that defining your own identity is what I think made us understand who we were. And then, of course, came the what I call a “chingasos.” …Oh, I shouldn’t cuss? "
,MC,"  Oh, no, no, no, no, the interview’s over (laughs). ",
,[Tape cuts], ,
,SL,"  I was a little bit, I was about two years older than Felicitas and Keta. They came straight from high school into the dorms. I came in as a transfer student. I was a little bit older. I don’t know [about] a little bit wiser, but I was, you know, a little bit older and I almost in a lot of ways played the older sister, you know, in a lot of my relationships with a lot of the women; and even in the organization, and that was good, uh, in a certain way but in another way— but, you know, when you’re young you’re not gonna listen to anybody, right? Especially you’re younger sister or whatever. My sister also, you know, came in the dorms, yeah. She was also there in the dorms. ",
,MC,  Okay. ,
,SL,  Go ahead. ,
,MC,"  Yeah, I was gonna ask you if you had gone to the conference, the youth conference, and you were telling me you didn’t go to the ’69 conference in Denver. ",
,SL,"  Yeah, I, you know, like I said it was second semester, uh, the second semester of— and I was on academic probation and I chose not to go, I chose not to go because at that point either I stayed in college or I flunked out. And I hadn’t worked this hard to flunk out; you know, that was the bottom line. And I had the sense enough to understand that I had to begin to pull back and that’s when I— I had met some people from Sacramento and they had told me about a program and I got in the program because of who I was, because I was in politics. Uh, at that point I was traveling up and down the state with CHE, Chicano Higher Education, and those were the people that we would meet statewide to talk about developing, uh, chicano studies, a department of chicano studies. Uh, what was it all about, uh, you know, what do we do with it, uh, you know, it was a process, a very long process. So I knew people up and down the state. So, when I decided to leave I was fortunate enough that I had the contacts to go wherever in the state that I could go, and I ended up in Sacramento only because they gave me a full scholarship. They gave me a full scholarship with books, board, but not only that, I could travel anywhere I wanted. And, so, the guy that was in charge of the program, uh, you know, liked me enough as a person because I think he had respect for what I was doing, that I was so young and here I was in politics that I would go, “Hey, you know, I need to go to a meeting in LA,” or, “I need to go to a meeting in San Francisco,” and he goes, “Yeah, you know what? Here. Here’s the ticket for you to go.” ",
,"So, in my lifetime or in my— I was fortunate enough that I connected with people that, even though I didn’t have a dime to my name I was able to get around and just do all of these amazing things that I ended up doing, uh, when I was at, at, when I was— when I had barely come to San Diego and started getting involved with MEChA. That’s how I connected with women at City College, San Diego City College, and there was a group of women there and a strong MEChA that they were doing a lot of things in the community. And, somehow, I ended up connecting with them because, again, of my politics and we ended up having one of the first chicana conferences in San Diego, and did we know what we were doing? I don’t know if we knew what we were doing but we, you know, we had a great conference. We had a great conference, and in this conference we had people that were stone nationalist, you know, I mean— I’m gonna share those pictures and those agendas with you— that it was about being a chicana and then somehow we recruited people from East LA that were stone Marxist, okay? And I, I ended up, like I said, I ended up leaving to Sacramento because I knew that I would not survive academically. I left. ",,
,"When I came back, I came back as a professor of chicano studies. I taught introduction classes, I taught organizing classes, and I taught the chicana class. And part of that, all those classes, my role was to connect the students to the community. And, so, part of the assignments that I used to do for my students was, “Okay, these are the different things that you can do out in the community.” You know, “You can work in the schools, you know, you can do tutoring, uh, you can do counseling, or you can go work with chicano rights organizing.” We were, uh— because as students we had been connected with a community, we were connected to all these different organizations in the community that we could just plug in the students and then they, in turn, would bring in more people. So, we had a very strong connection with the community and everybody felt we were all in it together, okay? ",,
,"Uh, but what ended up happening was that I think you had— as we got bigger, as we recruited more people and more students came in and more faculty came in and, uh, San Diego was, like, this was— it was happening here. Uh, you had a lot of groups from LA and from San Francisco come in. You had people from the Communist Party, you know, come here, participate in some of our meetings. We didn’t know they were communist, you know? And this was about the time that we started questioning a lot of the ideology of nationalism, especially with the women, uh, because as a student— we started as a big group of women that came in through the EOP program, and by the end of the year there was very few left, very few left. And then chicanas would come in and then they were gone in a couple of months or, I mean, in a year. I mean, they weren't staying in school, they weren’t graduating. It was true overall of chicanos, but, of course, more so of the women. And you're trying to figure out what was going on. Well, what was going on? Well, it was real obvious to a lot of us that started meeting in groups and started organizing. Well, it was very obviouSL","  a lot of sexual exploitation was going on, you know? A lot of the leadership was, in fact, taking advantage of the young women that, they were innocent. I mean, they didn’t— not all of them, of course, but that was certainly going on. Uh, in the, uh, in the roles of the organization, uh, you know, women were regulated. You know, “You’re the secretaries, you’re the cooks,” and that’s the way it was at the meetings. ",
,"Uh, I mean, we started voicing our discontent and people started getting pretty upset with us and we were— a lot of us were blackballed. Uh, by the time I left, I left in ’70, I was certainly blackballed. I was a target. And, uh, I ended up in Sacramento thinking, “Okay, I’m gonna go over there and just finish my education,” right? So, when I went over there I, uh, I tried not to get involved because it was all about school, right? I was gonna do my teacher-training program. It was the first bilingual bicultural teacher training program in the nation, and I went to school with a lot of people from Texas, as a matter of fact. A lot of people from Texas came; they recruited. So, here I was with a lot of, um, I always felt I ended up with all of these very intelligent people that had a lot on the ball and, you know, I was not a good student in high school. Maybe I was a “C” student. You know, I don’t know how I graduated but I did. So, I always felt— “I always end up with all these smart people,” and, “What am I doing here?” And, so, when I went to Sacramento I felt the same way and I go, “Okay, I’m gonna focus on my studies,” or whatever. ",,
,"But somehow I always ended up in classes with people that were like, “Hey, you know, it’s about the politics. It’s about what’s going on.” I ended up— one of my mentors in Sacramento became my political science teacher and he was a chicano that after I left he became mayor of Sacramento and he, uh, he served, I don’t know, maybe three or four terms, yeah. Joe Serna, Joe Serna was his name and he would, uh, he would always challenge me in the classes and then I ended up joining, uh, I became a performer. I joined a teatro. I joined— there was a teatro that was formed by José Montoya ,The Jalapeños, and I became part of that group and we would perform at different functions. We would perform some of Octavio Paz’s pieces. And, so, I, I struggled with the fact of finishing my education but at the same time being in the politics and doing what needed to be done, whether it was here in San Diego or it was in Sacramento. ",,
,"In Sacramento I, uh, I ended up getting involved in, like, as part of the things that we were training, like doing breakfast programs at the, uh, at the elementary schools, you know, uh, doing tutoring. We ended up organizing in Sacramento to get a center there. It’s still there. Uh, having art classes in the community, I mean, you name it. Uh, uh, going to the prisons, you know, to teach chicano studies, to do different things, and I ended up, I ended up leaving Sacramento State, graduating, because my family was having a lot of problems in Imperial Valley. I grew up— my father was an alcoholic. And, so, I grew up in a, in a family where alcoholism was very accepted because in the neighborhood that we lived [in], almost everybody was an alcoholic. It was, like, part of the program. If you, among farm workers, I mean, I think people don’t really want to talk about it, but alcoholism is, you know, almost part of poverty? Uh, I don’t know. I don’t know. It’s a way to deal with the pain and the hard work. ",,
,"So, you know, to me in Calexico, the abuse of women that I grew up with and the alcoholism, it was like you accepted it because you lived with it but in my mind I knew that it was not right. So I think as I moved through my journey, you know, something always told me, you know, “I’m not, I’m not going to go back to what I’m supposed to be or be a product of  what my environment was gonna regulate me to.” So, I fought that, you know, very, very hard all throughout college, you know, to the point where I was, I was engaged to get married when I started San Diego State and, of course, I got involved in the Anti-War Movement because, you know, we had so many chicanos that were being killed in Vietnam. But, yet, my fiancé was a, you know, he was in Vietnam. And, so, when he came back in ’69 and wanted to marry me, you know, he had become a Green Beret, I think, in Vietnam, and these were, like, trained killers, right? And he was, he was very proud of the fact that, you know, he had killed so many Vietnamese. And to me that was, like, there’s no way I can marry you. There’s— you know, we had moved in different times and in different spaces. I had gotten politicized but he had, you know, gone to war and, so, when he came back I, uh, I broke my engagement, you know, with him. And that was ver— it was hard on my mom. ‘Cause she goes, “Ay, what’s gonna happen to you?” You know, “You’re not gonna have a man take care of you.” You know, that. So, she was very sad that I didn’t get married because she was planning the wedding and, you know, everybody was planning the wedding and I was like, “I don’t think so,” you know? ",,
,"So, I left Sacramento and I ended up in Calexico because one of my brothers who had become a heroin addict, you know, had, uh, been having a lot of, uh, problems. He had gotten arrested, he had been on the run, uh, and, again, uh, it was, it was, like, no big thing because in Calexico drug addiction is horrendous. Uh, at one point, I don’t know how many years ago but one time I remember reading an article on Calexico that it had the highest per capita heroin addict per population, something like that. Yeah, it was, like, it came out, I remember— I think I saved that article. But it was— and, so, it was— we knew— you know, these were some of the issues that we were getting involved in the movement but at the same time it was normal because, you know, it was part of growing up with, uh—. ",,
,"Anyway, uh, at that point what my professors, some of my professors, they were trying to help me, I remember, uh, they were gonna try to get me into Stanford, into Stanford to go to school, and, uh, you know, I just got up and left. I didn’t even tell them that I was leaving because I had, uh, again as one of the oldest in the family, the girl, you know, the one that your mom always turns to, uh, I mean, I dropped everything in my life. I dropped everything in my life. Uh, I didn’t tell anybody. I mean, these were people that were paying my way to travel everywhere, these— and I didn’t— and you know, looking back I go, “Why, why did I do that?” But the pressure of the family, you know, the pressure of the family to always be there for your family and I think, uh, I think throughout my life and still now I think you, at least for me, I still struggle with, uh, you know, your family issues in terms of putting priority. You know, how much do you help your mom, how much do you help you dad, how much do you help your brothers and sisters, uh, because for me, from, well, I guess, from the time I was ten years old when my mom started working, it’s a struggle that consciously or unconsciously I’ve always had to maneuver my way. Uh, because if I look back, if it would have been up to my mom I would have graduated from high school, gotten married, and had children and that would have been like a lot of my girlfriends, uh, a lot of my girlfriends, you know, getting pregnant. Sometimes, you know, on accident, you know, sometimes a way to get out of the house, sometimes a way to get the guy to marry them. You know, it’s something that we don’t like to talk about but it was very, very, at least it was very much a reality with me, and I knew I wanted to leave the house, and I did get engaged, but I wasn’t gonna leave the house that way. I was going to leave it because I needed to better myself, you know, to find a way out of poverty, and education was the way how I left. Uh, with dignity, with a goal, but, uh, that’s when I dropped out of, uh— they were looking into a master’s program that it was both a master’s and a PhD or something like that and some of the people that I went to school with ended up in Stanford, but I had to go back to Calexico. And—.",,
, [TAPE CUTS],,
,SL,"  …Like I told you, people from all over the United States, to train them in bilingual and bicultural education, it was the first program in the nation. And, so, I remember when I started the program it was all these people from Texas. And, so, the director was always bringing in different people and one of the people he brought was José Angel Gutierrez and he told us, you know, why it was important to have— and that he was recruiting teachers and all this kind of thing. And he also brought Reies Lopez Tijerina. I took a picture, but I remember getting into a little scuffle with him because when he would talk he would, uh, do analogies, sexual analogies, when he would talk about things and I’m going, “Hey, you know, why are you always, you know, making analogies, like, with women?” And I can’t remember the exact thing. ",
,MC,  You challenged him? ,
,SL,"  I, I kinda challenged him, yeah, I kind of— and, you know, who, who in the— but I didn’t give a shit, I mean, I was young and I was a kind of— growing up in the environment that I grew up with, you know, we had, you know, my dad was an alcoholic, my grandfather lived with us, he was an alcoholic, and then we had my two uncles that lived with us and then my brother. So, I mean, I was brought up in a tough environment so to speak. And, then in the poor side of town where, you know, drug addiction— and, so, you had violence and roughness and, and I grew up with that. So, I wasn’t afraid, you know? I’m— when, when, uh, like, I was at MEChA meetings or whatever, I wouldn’t be afraid to challenge men because I had to do it in order to survive. Uh, so I think it was like a skill that I, that I— it wasn’t— it didn’t mean that I wasn’t afraid of things, but I had to survive my environment and, so, I kind of transplanted those skills to survive, you know, in San Diego and then in Sacramento or wherever I went because when I got into the political arena, you know, you met with some guys, you know, like Tijerina, I mean, these were bigger than ourselves, right? These figures were, like, they were the gods and everything they did and everything— and my attitude was, “I don’t think so.” I mean, they were leaders, you know, they were doing a lot of good things, but, you know, we in our own right, no era— people talk to me these days, “Oh, you remember?” I go, “Oh, I used to do that?” They go, “Yeah.” I go, “Oh, no. I wasn’t.” That, that, how— I was pretty brave. Put it that way. I also got into an argument with Corky (laughs). I also got into— ",
,MC,  What was that about?,
,SL,"  And I think they took a picture. Uh, I think he said something about, something about the movement, uh, he made an analogy about, uh, the movement and an orgasm with women or whatever and I’m like, you know, very poor taste. In very poor taste. And I’m like, “Hey, you know, what, you know, do you know what you’re saying? Do you know how—?” You know, just calling these guys, in kind of like a nice way. Not like, “Véte a la chingada,” or something like that, you know? It was like, “Hey, you know what? We’re movement people and so it wasn’t hostile but at the same time trying to reason with some of these guys because some of these guys you couldn’t, you couldn’t reason. Just like with, uh, with a lot of the women, you know? I, I ended up, I ended up coming back, uh, to San Diego. I was— I went back to the Valley and I started getting involved in the politics over there in, uh, in Calexico and I needed a job. I ended up working as a counselor in the high school that I went back to because I needed a job, and my, uh, one of my coworkers would say, “Hey, you know, Sonia, you need to finish your teaching credential.” And I go, “No.” You know, I got right into the politics of Calexico because when I went back you still had all white teachers, you still had— nothing had changed. I had changed, but in Calexico not a whole lot of things— the  Farm Workers Movement was very strong but the political machinery and the, the stronghold of the education, it was all the same. ",
,"And, so, my girlfriend and I decided that she was gonna run for office. I became her campaign manager. Uh, people thought, you know, I was crazy and they came after me because, you know, I went in as a counselor and I’m going, “Okay, so, we don’t even have a counseling center in Calexico High School?” I mean, this is— I think I went back in, was it..okay. I went back in ’70 and then I went back in ’75. The second time, the second time that I went back, yeah, the second time…was it the second time? Yeah, the second time I went back I, that’s when one of my girlfriends ran and she stayed on the school board for about fifteen years and she became, uh, president of the board and if she wouldn’t have gotten elected I wouldn't have gotten fired. Because by that time I had been at the high school about a year and here I thought, “Oh, I’m in the movement here, trying to do a lot of things;” uh, calling teachers about what was going on and so forth. ",,
,SL," And, so, when she got elected, I mean, they didn’t even have a counseling center. They didn’t even have a counseling center.  I mean, this is 95% the kids are chicano, hardly anybody’s going to college, I mean, this is 1975, you know? Nothing had really changed here. So I got into the politics of things and, of course, I could not end up— I didn’t stay. I didn’t stay in Calexico because I didn’t fit in anymore. You know, I, again, I wasn’t going to get married, have children, and there’s nothing wrong with that, but I wasn’t ready, you know? The first time that I left from Sacramento, I think it was ’70 or ’71, I can’t— more or less, I went to Calexico, I got picked up by San Diego State and coming back here ’71, I think, yeah. And that’s when I started teaching the classes here at San Diego State. And I was telling you about the chingaso started coming when a lot of us started embracing, uh, the class struggle, you know, started talking about sexism, started talking about racism, started talking— I mean, we had been talking about racism all along because of the Nationalist Movement, but we began to educate ourselves a lot politically and start, you know, studying Marxism and start to talk about the contradictions. Like, especially with the women, you know, in the organizations and the whole sexual exploitation that was going on and people started getting really nervous, very threatened. Uh, the people in the community started getting upset, and rightfully so because we had a lot of my colleagues became very dogmatic, very, very dogmatic. And what started happening was you had some of these people that became very dogmatic bring in some people that were very dogmatic from LA, very dogmatic from San Francisco. And, so, what would happen was that we would have meetings, okay, because we would have these huge meetings, people would pack ‘em, you know, so that whatever they wanted, the arguments would go this way or that way and that’s when we started having, like, a split, a split in San Diego. ",
,SL," And what ended up happening was, uh, supposedly some people representing the community came to the college president and said, “These people don’t represent the community here at San Diego State University,” and, so— because we were getting very powerful to begin with. We were not satisfied with what we would get. For instance, if MEChA got $20,000 that year, next year we wanted $30,000, you know, to do more things. Uh, we wanted more classes, and, of course, yeah, we were doing some things that were not acceptable to the college and we knew it; we knew that we shouldn't be doing that, but we were doing it anyway because we were gonna do things on our terms because that’s what was gonna work with us. And one of the things was, like me, or a lot of the younger people in the department, we would give ten percent of our salary to a, to a kitty, so to speak, to be used for whatever it could be used, whether it was— we had a kitchen for students, you know, chicanos that couldn't afford to buy meals or whatever, so if you would go and work there an hour or two, you could eat there, okay? Or to start a childcare program for the women that they were coming to school but they couldn't afford childcare, so other women would be taking— you know, but we would get our own money. And, of course, you weren’t supposed to be doing things like that. ",
,SL," And then, uh, like in the classes, you know, it was supposed to be about academics. And when they found out that sometimes we would allow students not to come to class because they were doing work in the community and as long as they had their project, as long as they were doing what they were supposed to be doing, it was okay with me, and I was being called, “Hey, you know, you’re not being a strict professor in terms of how the university—.” So, we were doing a lot of untraditional things and, of course, we were confronting a lot of the class issues and, so, we were moving away from the nationalism. And what happened was there was a split. There was a split at San Diego State"," the nationalist camp and the Marxist, Leninist camp. And the Marxist Leninist camp, they were forced to leave. They were forced to leave. Uh, I, I felt I was fortunate in that I was given a choice that, you know, I could stay or that I could leave. I felt that I needed to leave because, you know, if people were gonna go down, I was gonna go down with them. I, I had been working a lot in the community that people would go, “Hey, you know what? If you want to stay, it’s okay. You’re not so much to the left. You’re not so much,” you know, “You’re not such a dogmatist,” or whatever. As a matter of fact, Rita took my job. Or, not took my job— I left my job, or, you know, because of the split what happened— the classes that I was— she picked up the classes that I was teaching. I knew who she was and she knew who I was but, you know, at that point a lot of us we kind of went our own ways. And, I never really— you know, I would see her and I would talk to her but we never really sat down and talked until we would run into, into different occasions, right? “Hello,” or whatever, but there was never a discussion about, “Hey, what happened here?” Right? "
,Rita, Right. ,
,MC,"  So, then you picked up the chicana class. ",
,Rita," Yes, because of Seros [ T7 2","44]. He said, “You don’t have to teach that. You could teach— you’re an English teacher. You can teach whatever you want.” And I said, “No, I wanna do what the chicanas were doing before. I’m not gonna go against what they started and what they’re doing. So, I want to teach the chicana class, because I’m here because the students need a teacher, and somebody has to teach the students that are here. So, if I don’t come and stay and teach the students, they won't have a teacher.” So, because one of the women from, from las chicanas group came and said, you know, “You can't— you shouldn’t be here. You should leave.” And I— and, uh, and I said, “If I leave who’s gonna teach the students? And, so, I’m here to teach the students. That’s what— you have— that’s the problem that you had here and I’m listening to what you have to say but I’m only here for one reason and I came all the way all from Northern California with my two children to teach the students that are here.” "
,SL,"  Yeah, there was a lot of, um, there was a lot of turmoil. A lot of, you know, San Diego State University definitely wanted us out because we became very strong. You know, we kept getting more classes, uh, our enrollment kept going up, uh, if we would call a demonstration, anything [snaps] I mean, we would have hundreds of people over there and the administration had to bend; whether it was a class or we needed a building or we needed money. Because at this time, remember the Vietnam War was at it’s peak, the Civil Rights Movement was at it’s peak, um, you had the white left, you know, organizing all over San Diego, I mean, their movement was at it’s peak, the Women’s Movement was organizing. They had just established the Women’s Program at San Diego State, and we were able to form coalitions with all these groups. So, as a group we were— we became a very strong force, and when we kept moving more and more to the left, especially with, you know, what I felt with some of the nationalists that they resented the fact that if you called them on, you know, like their sexism that, hey, you know if we had a party and people got really out of hand that it was okay, but it wasn’t okay. You know, that the men be respectful of women, that it wasn’t okay that they’d not respect women. We were trying to build a different culture, not just, uh, yeah, it was good to be Raza but, you know what? We need to move forward. Let’s deal with the sexism, let’s deal with the classism, let’s deal with all these issues that really are the issues that divide us. Yes, the racism has heard us and we do need to build our culture, you know, we do need to be proud of who— but all these contradictions started coming together. ",
,SL,"  Anyway, I ended up in what I call, you know, “the group that left.” And I ended up leaving out of my own choice. I felt that I couldn't work with some of the people that had purged the department, so to speak, and I ended up teaching at Fullerton State. I got recruited to go teach at Fullerton State teaching the chicana class. Uh, when I was at State I was also, uh, I also taught at San Diego City College as— uh, community organizing classes. Um, during the summers, you know, that’s some of the things— I was fortunate that, you know, I wasn’t married and that I didn’t have children, so I was able, I was able. You know, I was everywhere. If there was a meeting in San Francisco, I’d go to San Francisco. If there was a meeting in LA, um, you know, I saw Ana Nieto on a regular basis because we belonged to CHE or we belonged to the statewide MEChA, so I connected with a lot of— I remember— I don’t know how I met— you keep, uh, talking about— is it Lupe Anguiano? ",
,MC,  Mmhmm. ,
,SL,"  You know, I know that I met her and, you know, I don’t know where, I don’t know, but I haven’t had a chance to look at my archives and look at my pictures and look at all the things that I have. I also remember being involved— I got involved in Raza Unida in San José, uh, being part of a coalition. Uh, I did a lot of things. I went to Mexico City for the women’s conference. Uh, I was part of the group that organized, uh, to call for amnesty because at that time that’s what it was all about. And amnesty came, you know, like ten years later. And the group that really pushed that was the group from LA, you know? I’m trying to remember some of the names. I can’t remember but I know I had pictures. I have a bunch of slides from the, uh, I remember that we had a big battle with the black women from Chicago, as a matter of fact, or from the US because they were strong and they were powerful, but this was an international conference and it was, like, all issues and as chicanas, you know, we got, we forced ourselves. But, uh, that was a hard process to do. ",
,MC,"  How did you come to go to Mexico City? Do you remember? Can you recall that time? That was in 1975, wasn’t it? ",
,SL,"  1975. Well, I got to go because I think I was just one of the political players in San Diego, you know, one of the chicana players, so to speak. There was a lot of us, uh, and even though I had left San Diego State, I wasn’t officially teaching, I was still doing a lot of things, you know, in the community that, uh, there was a busload of us that, that went. Uh, I remember Yolanda López was— uh, I used to kind of associate with her a lot because at one point when I was teaching at, uh, State, I wanted to put an anthology together that I never put. Uh, I’m not gonna mention any names but, um, some of the material that I had, you know, gotten, I had shared with people, and it got used without permission.  And, so I was the one who ended up getting burned because people go, “Hey you know what? You’re using my material.” And, because I, you know, and, and and I let things go. And some of those materials I haven’t been able to find some of the women and I’ve kept it. Uh, I have some drawings, for instance, from Yolanda López that she did of Los Siete in San Francisco, you know, little drawings or whatever that she had given to me because I was gonna put them in this anthology, but I ended up leaving San Diego and I didn’t. ",
,SL,"  Uh, I used to do writings, like, for newspapers, I used to do panels on TV, you know, anything you wanted me to do that had to do with the movement, I would do it. Especially when it came to the whole thing with the women issue. So, I was always in the landscape, so to speak. Um, right now I, I retired and after I retired— you know, people go and take a vacation. You know what I did was I, I ended up going back to taking— I had previously gone to law school, I went to law school, but I took the bar but I never passed the bar. So, I ended up going into the career counseling and after I finished I go, “Okay, I’m gonna do the immigration thing because that’s one of the things that I feel very passionate about.” So as soon as I retired I asked a friend of mine that teaches at one of the law schools that’s an immigration specialist if I could take her class and she goes, “Yeah!” She even gave me her books, and, you know, which was great. So, when I took the immigration class in law school in the eighties, the immigration code was like this [pinches fingers together], okay? When I went back in ’09, the immigration code was like this [spreads index finger and thumb far apart], okay? It was like this. It was like trying to figure out the tax code. ",
,SL,"  So, my, my, my passion now is the whole issue with immigration because I think that’s the priority for our community. So, I went back and I, and I took that class with the idea in mind that that’s where I want to do volunteer work or whatever. I was gonna start doing volunteer with the abused women, you know, they have a, if you’ve been— as a woman if you’ve been abused and you’re undocumented or if you’ve been a victim of a crime, you know, that’s a pathway to legal residency. So, anyway I— that was my first priority, to get— and, so, that’s what I devoted myself to in the last couple of years and that’s how I ended up going to Chicago, being in the, in the immigration, you know, network. And I still feel very, you know, very strong about it. I go, “Ah, why aren’t people getting more militant?” You know, like I am, I’m not— I’ve— in January I had surgery. I had, you know, very serious problems and I’m just trying to— and I go, “Ay,” you know, “Obama’s gonna be coming this week, you know, why aren’t people organizing a big demonstration on immigration?” You know, I’m sitting back here ‘cause I know some of the people that are working on the issues and this is where you can get, you know, national, you know, priority. This is where you can get media, this is where you can— I go, “Why aren’t people doing that kind of thing?” ",
,SL,"  Anyway, with immigration it's become so complicated and the reason it became a priority is because I worked as a counselor and I saw hundreds and hundreds of kids that, they’re not supposed to have a future? Um, kids, you know, depressed, even talk about suicide because, I mean, it’s— can you imagine you not being able to drive? Can you imagine— I mean, it's like, so, you know, where are our priorities in terms of, uh, you know, us as political, you know, people? So, my, my, commitment so to speak— my energies, I’ve never really stopped. I’ve just kind of moved from one space, you know, to the other, like when I walked in that she had the t-shirt, I was gonna wear it and tell you about this conference, you know, that I did for 19 years, 19 years, you know? A whole— yeah, and this last year they recognized the founder which was me and probably because, I didn’t leave in, how should I say? Good terms. ‘Cause I always, I always push the envelope, you know, I always go that extra, that extra step. I mean, we have this conference every year, okay? This conference brings in 800, about eight, nine hundred people a year and we bring these young women, you know, from thirteen to eighteen and they bring their mothers, okay? And we have workshops for their mothers, you know, violence in the family, or, you know— and then we have workshops for the young girls. You know, why is it important to go to college? You know, do you want to be an attorney, do you— asp— high risk girls, high risk girls. And, so, we have a big platform, you know, you have a day to influence people and to me it's always about politics because as far as i'm concerned, everything is political. Who you sleep with, you know, is political. I mean, I don’t, I don’t, I don’t— there’s no question. And, so, I always— if we’re gonna have, you know, people a whole day paying attention, let’s do the— so I’ve always been at odds with people no matter where I work. I mean, we had this event, right? I mean, did we bang heads? Yeah, we banged a lot of heads because, you know, you wanna— I feel that, I feel I always wanna— [phone rings].",
, [TAPE CUTS],,
,SL,"  So, I, I, uh, I’m trying to mellow down in my old age. ",
,MC,  Please don’t. ,
,SL,"  And, I’m trying to, um, you know, Rita was talking earlier about her genealogy and I really wanna, you know, look into that because when I went to law school I found out that we had a right to be here in the US because my grandfather was born and raised in San Bernardino. My great grandparents are founders of San Bernardino. You know, it’s a history I didn’t know. If you have a US— if— my mother didn’t have to immigrate. She had the right to citizenship because her father— but because you’re poor and because you're not educated you don’t know, you don’t know, you know? And she had the right to— I go,  when I finished my immigration class I go, “Mom, you know that you can be a US citizen, like, you’re already a US citizen, because of your dad.” I mean, and we didn’t know about it, just small— you know? Yeah, her, her, father was— my great grandmother was born in San Bernardino and she was raised at what is called— what is now Saint Bernadette? It was a different, it was a different, uh, by a different name; the mission, the mission there. ",
,SL,"  And, so, when they came, when my great grandfather came, you know, at that time you could just get a piece of land and that became their land and she was left widowed with seven boys. So, in order to make it, she, uh, she opened a restaurant, a bar. At that time, no. Before she opened the bar — no, she— it was told to us that, I guess, prohibition, she used to make, uh, she used to make it in the cellar and that’s one of the ways that she survived. And then later on she opened a bar when it became, uh— but, you know, she was left by herself with seven boys and my grandfather was the oldest. And when the war broke out, he was supposed to go but she ended up, because they were in the cattle business also, he would go to Mexico, buy cattle, and bring it in. So, he did that and that’s how he met my grandmother and brought her to this side. ",
,SL,"  So, some of the kids were born here and some of the kids were— but, see, all that history, uh, my, my great grandmother ended up dying. You know, there was problemSL","  who took the property, because there was a lot of property. People stopped talking to the family and my mother was in Mexico and they became— my grandmother died and my grandfather came back to San Bernardino, and my grandmother's family didn’t want the kids, you know, to be brought here, but some of the kids did end up coming here, some of the kids that were born on this side and a lot of—so, you know, I started saying, “Hey, you know what? I have a history. I have a history in the Southwest that I never knew about because in school it wasn't covered.” You know, nobody told me. And I st— you know, it became part of my growing process. So, I have a lot of relatives in San Bernardino. You know, my great grandparents, um, I talked to a cousin of mine and I’m gonna— I called one time and the recorder’s office and I was asking something and they go, “Oh, yeah. You have a big family here. They’re part of the founders,” of San Bernardino. And I’m like— so, that’s one of the areas that I wanna research, that, uh, my great grandmother, my great grandmother and my grandfather."
,SL,"  So, that’s why to me the whole, you know, immigration is so— because we had a right to be here, but yet we had— and just because we didn’t have education, just because we were poor, we didn’t have the knowledge, you know? And I decided I was gonna educate myself so I, I just let people know, you know? Just if, uh, just like something really simple, uh, people think that because they’ve been arrested a couple of times that that completely bars them but that’s not true. It depends on the situation, it depends on the cases, and, you know, if you haven’t been, uh, advised that it could hurt your— you know, you have to wipe it out, you have to go through a process. Me entiendes? It’s very, very complicated but if you know the law, you know? That’s why [the] immigration issue is so important. I think it’s top priority in our community. And after that I think the economics and everything because it goes hand in hand. What I want to do in the future, Maria, is I want to write, because I've started writing a couple of times. I’ve started an anthology a couple of times and I haven’t completed it and I plan to complete it. That was the reason I started the oral history project. ",
,MC,"  And do you want to say a little bit about the oral history project to finish up? I think it’s a really good way to end this interview, to talk about why, you know, you’re doing it and what it entails and why it’s important to this community and to the nation. ",
,SL,"  Well, you know, I, um, I’ve always had, I guess, that historical, uh, what is it? Uh, focus, um, because all throughout the movement I would always take pictures. I would always take pictures and I would always, I would always save everything, you know? Uh, to the point that, um, my mother used to get really upset and she’d throw a lot of my stuff away. But a lot of my stuff I was able to save. Uh, I was able to save, um, some of the film of, you know, the takeover of Chicano Park and some of the activities that we have here that we were able to put online, and then I was able to— I had some music from back in the day that I was able to save and I turned it into the archive. It had a song on the chicana"," “Chicanita,” it’s not out there because people haven’t heard it but it’s one of the songs from the movement and I was able to turn it into the archives. Um, like I told you I had this ambition to do an anthology and I did get a lot of stuff from people and I turned it back. Some of the stuff I have, I'm still trying to locate some of the owners and throughout the years I’ve been able to give some back. I have some artwork from Yolanda, I know she's okay now. Uh, I haven’t seen her or talked to her. You know, there’s been a lot of people in my life that I’ve done things with and I like to share some of those histories and some of those stories and some of those pictures. "
,SL,"  I had put an album of the teatro together; a picture. And I had them come over to the house and they took copies of the pictures, you know, and I still have the album. So, in San Diego, I feel that I’ve been fortunate enough to be— come into being who I was as a chicana. You know, I became a chicana. I was not a chicana. I was not a mexicana. But when I came here I was a mexicana because that’s what I grew up with. But I became a chicana when I came to San Diego State and I got politically involved and I developed consciousness and I was very careful. Uh, at that time we were very careful to not say we were feminist because it was— we would be ostracized if we would say we were a chicana feminist. So, we were just, you know, chicanas. Because, you know, we were going through so many struggles in the Chicano Movement at that time. And, so, I’ve always had the focus to document who we are— who we were, who we are, and maybe where we’re going. And, so, I always took pictures, you know, saved stuff, and I’ve been— I feel I’ve been fortunate enough to go do a lot of politics when I was young and even now that I have a good grasp of things, the politics of, you know, how we came to be chicanas, you know, what chicana feminism is all about. And there’s different perspectives in San Diego and there’s different leaders. Some of us have come from the universities, but a lot of them have come from the community. And I feel that we need to tell the story of San Diego, uh, and it’s always been some of my passions. And I’m going, you know, “Why not?” You know, I don’t have— you know, do it on my own. I don’t have to do a deadline, I don’t have to deal with the university, I don’t have to give them back their camera or whatever. So, but I am soliciting, you know, uh, help from different people. Um, one of the women that was at the event, um, Fredi Avalos, uh, is a— she teaches in a communications department— she teaching in the communications department and in the English department? Both? ",
,Rita, I don’t think she teaches in the English department. ,
,SL,"  Just in communications? Just in the communications. Anyway, I met her, uh, she’s at Cal State San Marcos and I met her, I don’t know, in, in ’09 or 10, someplace because I was doing the thing with immigration and I connected with her. And, you know, we started talking or what have you and of course, being who I was, at one of the fundraisers I got up to speak, you know, what we’re doing, and, so I connected with her. And then when I started doing the project I thought, “Oh, where can I get help? I need help. I need resources.” So, I just started tapping into different people and that’s how I’ve been doing the project. Uh, totally on a volunteer basis; not a penny to my name, but were into quite a bit we’re into it. We already have quite a few interviews, uh, but I’m also part of the Chicana Chicano Archives that ties into what I’m doing so I’m working with the archives on the project. So, I’m just, uh, I’m just following what I think is something that needs to be told. ",
,Sl," You know, we have a story in San Diego that is unique and it’s different than all the other— there’s a lot of similarities but there’s a lot of uniqueness also. You know, we’re on the border, you have the influence of the mexicana, the influence of the, uh, the Latinas, that, you know, have made it and there’s that struggle that I feel, you know, still exists; is that whatever struggles, you know, it is about chicanismo because it’s about liberation of our people. It’s about educating our people. It’s about pulling our people out of poverty. I mean, we— I, I, I still hear the statistics on the news and we make, what, 70, 80 percent of the inmates in the prison system? You know, the drug abuse, the addiction, the poverty, and, I mean, what is it that people— and we have changed our community. Here in San Diego we have changed our— I, I, I started working at Sweetwater District, a South Bay— it’s the second-largest school district in the nation next to LA. That’s where I went to work with and I went in there and I went there as a, as a chicana making changes and I know that I did because I got involved in electing the people that make the decisions. I got involved in organizing conferences so young women— you know, I’ve had young women come and say, “I remember you.” You know, it made a difference that I went to that conference because after that conference I wanted to keep going every year, you know? And it changed my life and I think if you, if you change one life— I mean, my family, because of me, I brought everybody to college. I brought, you know, all of my brothers and my sisters, you know? ",
,SL," I went back, when I went back home I, I kicked my dad out of the house, you know, against my mother’s wishes because he was so abusive, you know? And nobody in the family thought that I could do that. And I said, “Why not?” You know, I legally had to get a restraining order against my own father. You know, so, I went into a district, mostly, you know, mexicano, majority a lot of low-income, you know? When I went in there was no— hardly any Latino teachers, counselors, administrators. That was, you know, 28 years ago or whatever. By the time I left it was different, but within our own people, as you know, there’s a lot of contradictions, you know? Once we get into a position of power we screw ourselves sometimes, and that’s what happened. So, I mean, we have, we have made a difference, you know? I feel that in my lifetime I have made a difference in my family’s life and in whatever community that I have lived. Because in whatever community, whether I was in Sacramento or I went back to Imperial Valley or when I was in San Diego, I stayed in the politics of what I felt. You know, like right now for me it’s immigration. You know, I, uh, I’ve been sick, but, you know, I, I, like I said I connected with Fredi because of being involved in the immigration issue, and, so, I’m hoping with the— once the immigration reform is passed I feel I have the tools to help out, but right now one of the things I’m focusing on— because I’m getting old and my health has suffered— that I want to do the oral history project. ",
,SL," It’s called the Chicano Oral History Project and what I want to do is tell the story of chicanas in San Diego. It’s a local mosaic, you know, because there’s been some beautiful women that have done beautiful things in San Diego and I don’t think they’ve been given the, the, the credit, the recognition, like, you know, when people talk about Chicano Park it’s all about the men. And there was some very strong, very, you know, uh, good women that were the key players of the takeover of the park. And when you talk to the men, you know, you talk about the history or whatever and they say— and I go, “Were there some women?” “Yes!”  The women— there was these women, they were very strong and they contributed. They were one of the key players, but in the history book— and nobody talks about them. They were, you know, they were key, you know? Their story needs to be told. ",
,SL," Uh, you know, Rachel Ortiz, uh, she took over the Barrio Station. The Barrio Station was part of the extension— one of the programs that was started by the, you know, Chicano Studies Department at San Diego State. Arturo Caceres was the first director and then, uh, Rachel Ortiz took over it and she’s been able to work with it for all these years and expand it, you know? She has a beautiful story. You know, she was, uh, she did prison time. She was, uh, a drug abuser and she was able to come out of that, became politicized, and has been giving back to the community. Those are the stories because a lot of us, you know, come from families that, like a lot of the chicano families, you know, there’s been a lot of pain, there’s been a lot of sorrow, but in spite of that, you know, these women have been able to come forth, make tremendous contributions to the community that have changed the community and there’s no recognition, there’s no stories. And for whatever reason, you know, I feel, hey, it’s something I’ve always wanted to do and I’m doing it.",
