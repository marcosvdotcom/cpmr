And I was pretty, um...I didn’t know it at the time, but I was pretty wounded, you know. I didn’t know what was going on, I didn’t know why the things happened that happened. And like they had even threatened, the guys and the teachers have even threatened my son. I mean...I...I was, ah, in...I was in shock. Kind of like in bomb shock. How do they call it?",socialist,
,I,Hm. Shell shocked.,,
,R,Shell shocked.,,
,I,Um-hum.,,
,R,"So they asked me to go speak. I said, “Okay, I’ll go speak.” And then I’m speaking, you know. And I don’t know what happened, but there was a big fight. And I don’t know if some guy...I think...I remember some guy saying something, and then another guy saying something. And then there was this (larujo 1:44) back and forth. And so then they were trying to get out of there. And there was like, you know, these guys, ah...ah, knights in shining arm—trying to protect me and...and...and these other guys. Then I go, I don’t even know what...“Why are you fighting?” you know. And then this smart guy says, “We better get you out of here and get you home.” I go, “That’s a good idea. Because I don’t know, I’ve already been in a buzz, and I have no idea what this buzz is all...I totally missed it, you know. If I could ever meet somebody who was out there, I’d like to ask them, “What...what went on?” So then [laughs] they take me home, they put me on a airport, in the airline, and I’m going home, and I go...I...I think I’m not going to speak anymore, because I...I don’t know what’s going on here, you know. My mom’s right. I should get out of here. I should get out of here for the...Oh, and then...So then when I went home, with my mom, she took me home. And my mom did not approve of was I...my involvement. But, you know, when...when shit it’s the fan, my mom was the only one there to, ah, take me home. ",,
,"And, ah, so this lady from the Socialist Party...was it Socialist Party...Because at that point, everybody approached me. And I didn’t know who these people were. Socialist Par—? I knew socialist, but ATM, there was another one...ah, I don’t remember.",,,

,R,"Anyway, um, so she kept on calling me and saying, “You need to join the party, we really need you. You know, we’ll support you,” this and that. So I said, “No, you know, I’m not doing anything. I don’t even know what you’re all about. I’ve only read, you know, some things that people have written. But I don’t know what you’re all about. So I ain’t doing it.” And so she kept on...she come in the middle of the night. She started harassing me, and she said, “Don’t you...aren’t...you’re so ungrateful,” you know, “We support you,” this and that. “You know, lady, you call me again, I call the police.” [laughter]. But it really brought out a lot of crazy people out of the woodwork, you know? And...and after my experience there at that conference, I go, “I don’t know what they’re fighting now, but everybody’s fighting about ideology.” Had already been through that ideology thing there, ah, with CASA, and, ah...everybody. And, ah, I said [laughs], “Been there, done that, ain’t going there.”",ideology,

,I,"Well, thank you, Anna, for agreeing to talk with us. And I know I’ve explained a little bit about what we want to do, and then that’s really kind of, um, get an understanding or provide a greater in-depth understanding about the development of Chicana feminism. Um, and so I think a good way to start this is to...to just ask you about, um, what your life was like growing up, and...and what led you, what you think led you to, um, your, you know, (conscienticacion 5:05). Like how...how did you come to that place? And then after we’ll talk a little bit about the first encounters with the Chicana Movement. But now I’d like to know a little bit about your background and your family and growing up.",,
,R,"Um-hum. Well, I think it was, um, ah, my environment. I was raised in San Bernardino, in California. It was a segregated community. Um, ah, which in LA...LA is segregated also, but the whole world is Chicano, or the whole world is Black, and so you’re not so aware of the...of the boundaries. And there’s so many people, I don’t think you’re...the police are all that involved unless you’re in Beverly Hills, that you don’t belong there. But in a small rural...I don’t know about rural town. Um, they range...raised, um, oranges, Santa Fe Railroad, and Kaiser were the main...main, um, employment. ",childhood,
,"So, ah, you know about racism, okay? You experience it in your daily life. Like, for instance, there was an informal curfew. If...so you know where the borders are and what happens if you don’t deal that...um, don’t observe that border. You experience it in the schools, you know. You...you raise your hand and the teacher will not call you, or when they call you, they’re full of disgust. Or they’ll shame the students. If you know an answer and nobody else knows the answer, then how can this dirty Mexican know?, you know. And they would say those things open with total confidence. Ah, so that part was very clear. And, um, quite frankly, I thought it was normal. And so I grew up thinking it doesn’t really matter what they think, because what they think is totally off the wall. What happ—what’s important is my mom, my dad, the family. And the West Side. Because the West Side was, ah, where the Chicanos live. ",,racism;childhood;education,
,"So when I went to, um, Cal State Long Beach, um, I just, um, met students that [clears throat], you know, were experiencing racism, the first alienation on the campus. I was too. And, ah, also racism in the...in the classrooms. Same thing – they wouldn’t answer your questions. You wait in line after the classroom to ask questions and the teachers were just...turn around and walk...walk away. They weren’t even going to hear what your questions were. So it was tough. So, um, ah, so when we began to organize, the way we were treated by the Chicano students, male...the males, was totally different than I had ever experienced, you know. And they, ah, they said I was like a chingada, they said, they thought I was totally dumb, because I didn’t know who Cesar Chavez is. I say, “Well, you know, I don’t know who Cesar Chavez is. But I know what this racism...racism is all about. You don’t have to tell me about that.” And, um, most of these Chicanos were from LA. So they hadn’t experienced. To them, their awareness was raised differently in terms of the...they had been raised with Chicanos and it...the school, the quality of the education, the whole horrible environment there, but it was different than from where I came. But they treated women like, um, their servants.",,chicanos,
,"I had never had that experience. My pop did not treat my mom like a servant. They were partners. Um, ah...they were partners, and they told me and they would tell everybody, that the only way they were going to achieve their dreams and a better life for their kids was for mom and dad to work together. So they worked together to achieve their dreams, be that...their dream was the house, to build a house, their dream house. Or to provide for us. [clears throat] And so my mom had always worked. My dad had always worked, but he couldn’t because he had a AA degree. He got two. First he wanted to be a mor...um, a mortician, because he was in Moore’s Marauders, he was a medic. And, ah, so he had the GI Bill to get a education. So while he was a medic, the doctors there were really impressed with him. And they said when the War is over, we’ll finance, we’ll get you money so you can go to John Hopkins. And, ah, but when my dad came out, he had shrapnel in his...he had experienced a brain...brain injury, and malaria. So it took him like...he was in quarantine for a very long time, before he actually was discharged. And he was still not well. So he pretty much thought he wasn’t in shape to be a doctor. But he loved the human body, and the...He was very curious guy. Very curious. And so he got his AA in that. And, but we were sick. He got it here in LA. But we were sick with asthma, because LA was like smogged to pieces, you know, black. And they thought we were going to die, because we couldn’t breathe. So, um, we had to move back to San Bernardino where the air used to be clean. And so he couldn’t find a job. You know, the main...the main morticians there were on the East Side and they weren’t going to hire a Mexican, because nobody wanted a Mexican to handle their dead. ",,childhood;feminism,
,"So he did find a job working with Tilly, who was a black businessman there. But he didn’t have enough business to support my dad full-time. So my dad went back to school. He got another AA degree in electronics, and then he got a job for the Feds in quality control. So all this time, he had been having problems because of discrimination. Even before he went to LA CC for his mortician degree, um, right away when he and my mom were going to get married, or planning to get married, he went to go get a job for the Santa Fe, because my mom had worked there since she graduated from high school. And, ah, my dad was there five o’clock in the morning. It was like, he said, he was number five there, because jobs were scarce there after the war. And the supervisor wouldn’t interview him. So fin—it’s quarter to five, and then he says, “I’m going to interview you. Don’t...you know, okay, let’s interview.” And my dad said, “Um-um.” And he said, “What do you mean? You have opportunity for a job.” He says, “I’m not working for you or people like you. I already had enough of that,” you know. “I’m...I’m a veteran and I need to be treated better.” So unfortunately being treated better meant working...like he ended up being a warehouseman at Edwards Air Force. It was, you know, jobs that...that, ah, he...he could have been doing better jobs than that. So while he was trying to work, find better jobs, my mom had to go back to work for the Santa Fe. ",,,
,"So I always knew them both as working. They always helped each other. They discussed things. My mom’s strengths and my dad’s strengths, they balanced each other. So my dad never felt alone, my mom never felt alone. They just, you know...I’m sure they had, you know, husband and wife problems as terms of always having different ideas. But they seemed to work it out. And then my grandpa also had – my mom’s dad – had that same kind of relationship with my grandma. And she...and he made sure that everybody got a grad—high school education. And so there was that positive, nurturing role models for men. And also, most of my dad’s peer group that we hung out with, they were all men from veterans. And they treated their women, you know, differently, but still they had the same idea, we had to work together. I think...I’m not...I really wasn’t aware who didn’t work and who did. But they all had active roles, it appeared to me. So...",,,
,[break],,,
,R,"...roles it appeared to me. So...so that was the environment I came from. So you go into MEChA, and you talk and nobody listens, you know. That...it was bizarre. Or you talk and maybe they’ll stop talking. But you say your ideas, and it’s not acknowledged, and they keep on talking, talking. And somebody else says exactly what you said. And Corinne and I...and it was a small group of people. In the beginning, it was a small group of people, forming UMAS. And so we were pretty much we thought on a equal basis. You think maybe ten at the most. Um, but it...you began to see that, um, class consciousness between men and women there. And so it wasn’t until I told (? 15:40) that we started cussing. And you cussed first. If you cussed afterwards, nobody’s going to listen, but if you cuss first, with gusto, you know, and maybe just as good or better than they did, they stopped and they listen. And so that’s...that’s when we started to be heard. And we were only two women. The rest...no, there was me, Corinne, Mary Lou, and another girl. But Mary Lou was very traditional. So she knew how to work that men-women thing, which I didn’t understand. But I noticed that they listened to her more, because she talked to the men and then through the men and they would talk. So I didn’t...I didn’t understand that. Now I do, but I didn’t at that time. But Corinne and I, we didn’t come from that world. So, ah, when we experienced that, then we figured out the game, and so we started acting more masculine, you know. Or big cuss word. Or, um...slam on the table, you know, or...You know, just everything that my mother would ki—do something...",,
,I,[laughs],,
,R,"...about. Okay? Ah, so, um...but in the beginning, I felt the way they were...was not very...was rude, disrespectful, that their mothers would be ashamed of them. And I would often threaten, “You know, I’m going to tell your mom. I’m going to talk to my mom, and she’s going to talk to your mom, and this is going to stop now.” But, you know, of course, I never met their mom, and my mom lived in San Bernardino, their mom lived in LA, and they weren’t ever going to talk to each other. And my family didn’t know their family, so there was not...not that accountability, so to speak. So we started acting like what they called (machas 17:45), you know. Um, but it was not acceptable at home. And so that was really hard to be a macha in this world and then in the real world be, you know, to behave in a educated way. You know, to behave with manners and courtesy and stuff, and no cussing.",,
,"                And I got to admit, you know, it was quite liberating to cuss. Because we were never supposed to cuss. And to get that kind of response...And because it was such a hostile environment, and like so and so’s, we didn’t realize it was a hostile environment. You know, we just figured these guys were difficult, but we had a goal to do. Um, we experienced an empowerment of being listened to. And we didn’t stop to think that if we have to go this far to be listened to, this is not really where we should be. We should...this is not a healthy environment, and either from our own organization or be somewhere where it’s healthier. We can promote ourselves as well as make things happen. ",,,
,"                But because we felt that we could manage it, we could handle it, you know, yeah, we just stuck with it. I think that’s pretty much it. Ah, but we questioned it. You know, like we were organizing a Chicana Studies conference, and like twelve o’clock. And only Corinne and I were there in the middle of the night. And we didn’t have, you know, copiers that collated. So you had like all these position papers. So it was a whole room, maybe three times the size of this, all these tables. We had all these position pa—And there Corinne and I were collating the...the position papers, you know. And so we would talk. And I said, “You know, Corinne, do you know...” Oh, because first we learned to cuss in Sp—ah, English, you know. I don’t want to say the words. Then we learned to cuss in Spanish. And then to cuss in Spanish, I said, “Do you know really what that means?” I said, you know, we’re really talking against ourselves. You know, we’re really attacking ourselves by saying that, especially in, um, Spanish. And then, especially the history.” Because I had read, ah, Octavio Paz, which I consider a very racist stereotyp (sic.) book, and I thought we shouldn’t use it. But I didn’t know what...what the roots were of, you know, chingada. And so I said, “Do you realize what we’re doing?” You know, “We’re just advocating attack on women, violence against women.” And Corinne says, “Look, it works, works for us. If it works, don’t fix it.” You know. ",,,
,"                So there wasn’t enough of us to really work that out and say, “No, nobody should be saying that, because it’s...it’s anti-woman. It’s promoting violence, you know. But we were having enough trouble as it was. So then, um, ah...so I...to answer the question is that because the MEChA, UMAS’s MEChA environment was so contrary to the way I had been raised, to the way that Corinne had been raised, that it was that experience that raised the woman’s question. Because we kept on having to...",,,
,"                Oh, and then...okay. So we experienced that in the growth from UMAS to MEChA. So when we started recruiting, ah, the students into MEChA and they would come in and they would want to know, and they would...They’re looking for a supportive environment, right? But, um, ah, somehow, part of the right of passage, it seemed for some men – some, not all – was for them to, you know, be macho, and part of being macho was, you know, sexually harass the women, to treat women like servants, to bully them, to become condescending to them. Or, you know, to make them feel important, you know, like be good to me, I’ll be good to you. ",,,
,"Um, and so...so we...when we started talking about raising awareness of the men and women, the women said, “We need to know more,” and they would raise questions and this and that. And so the dudes say, you know, ah...it was their idea really to form a woman’s organization, a woman’s committee. It was real—I never...but it was their idea, ah, to form a woman’s committee. And Corinne and I were supposed to meet with them and raise their awareness about, you know, racism, MEChA, what are the goals, this and that, you know, so that they didn’t have to waste their time with it, right? So we would. ",,,
,"And so what happens when you, ah, do some training and development with people? They start asking their own questions, and they start being more assertive, and, ah, questioning and evaluating reflecting back. And then guys weren’t all that very comfortable with that. So, but they wouldn’t ask the particular individuals about it. When we would have our leadership meetings, they would ask me and Corinne, “What did Norma mean when she said this?” “What did Helen mean when she said this?” I said, “How do I know?” You know, but it’s like all women think the same. Or it had something to do with what...our meeting with them. So I said, “You got to ask those people.” [laughs] I mean...",,,
,"But then, you know, like when you read about history and you read about racism, you see the same parallel. You know, the class whose got the...the leadership or the foreman or supervisor, it’s only going to talk to one person, and they have to explain for everybody else. And I go...this...we’re going backwards here. We’re going forwards. We were making such great strides in terms of organizing the student organization, recruiting students, developing a counseling program, retention program. Teachers’ program. I mean, we were just doing such positive things. But internally, it was becoming a hostile...it was a hostile environment. And I think that was often why...Because a lot of the young Chicano males who would come in there and see that, I think it was distasteful to them as well as to a lot of the women, and they wouldn’t come back. And then the MEChAs would say, “Where is everybody? We work so hard for them but they’re not here, you know? Ah, and only those who had maybe experience with that and thought they could hand that stayed. I don’t know why people stayed and why they didn’t. I don’t know why I stayed and I didn’t. So I...but, you know, someone else can figure that out.",,,
,"Um, so that’s how the women’s question raised. So when that started happening, and then as a counselor with EOP and working in this training and development community with the women, they were coming up these problems as far as retention issues. That’s what we called retention issues. And they were different than what we were hearing from the men. And a lot of the young men, what their issues were, were a lot about identity. And some of them, this male identity...because they were now men. And what does that mean? And to be a man means, you know, I should be outside working, but here I’m still dependent, I’m a student. You know, I don’t think my father really respects me here. ",,,
,"Ah, so there’s a lot of things about identity for the men that they were working out one way or the other. And they...and they would share that with me because I was their counselor. But I don’t know what went in in MEChA. They discussed that. ",,,
,"But with the women, it had everything to do with homesickness, pressure from family and friends and boyfriend to go home, you know, what are they doing?, to, choices, being independent, um...feeling different. Not just among a white Anglo organi—institution. Because they lived in the dorms. But also they were different, you know, because they...there was all...such a heavy stereotype on what a Chicana should be. And like you’d talk to all these different they...you know, “I’m not like that.” It’s like there was a stereotype. So there was pressure to be something they weren’t. And they were wondering, “What’s wrong with me?” [laughs]",,,
,"So...so we started to address that, you know, and support them, and just have them explore. And then there was the whole thing about, even though, um, birth control had been around for a couple of years, it wasn’t really something that I knew about. And it was just becoming accessible there at the student health center. But it wasn’t to everybody. I don’t know why. But it wasn’t to everybody. And so, um...oh, I think it was at that point they were just giving it to students who were having...in college. And so those women who knew that was the line, then they would, you know, put that. But, ah...that was just a small group of people who knew how to play the system. ",,,
,"Ah, so there was again, the sex thing, you know, sexual...ah, should I have sex with my boyfriend over there in Fresno or Visalia, or wherever I am. And then the sexual harassment that would come in, you know, with these cool, um...Don Juans, you know. And it was really men just trying to practice on their...their spiel, you know, their pick-up (run 29:28). I mean, these were just young men trying to learn how to do it right. Um, so, ah, and then the girls would fall in love and...All that kind of growing up problems. ",,,
,"And so, ah, I became very aware of how serious it was when we were doing statistics and...In EOP we saw where the women had higher grades than the guys did. And I go, wow! That’s amazing. And I wondered why. And then...but the women had higher drop-out rate. And I said, whoa! That’s a loss, you know, why? Um, and so I said...as a matter of fact, these women were doing a whole lot better than I. You know, they had a lot better skills than I had. And...because if you have so many B’s and so many A’s and just a few C’s, that was not my story.",,,
,"So I go. There’s...why are they going? So the...just a group like Corrina, just...Martha...just a group that ended up being (ijas 30:45). We started, you know, having women, ah, just a random sampling of women. And really it was about, um, pressure from home to get married, ah...getting pregnant, or having sex – not getting pregnant, but being dumped, and wondering what that was all about. And now they were fallen women, you know. They had...they had been betrayed and they had betrayed their family, they had betrayed this and that. And then those women who...who already had...had sexual experience, um, I don’t...I don’t know why they left. But there was something...something there too, however they interpret it. ",,,
,"So it took...it took something special for those women to stay on. And those women who did stay on usually were able to develop their own peer group along their...their interests. Like if they were artists, you know, they...they got recognized within their own group of interests. Um, so...but it wasn’t coming from MEChA. You know, MEChA was not helping the women stay on...on campus. So, um, one time – I’ve told this story a hundred times...but, not one time, but a couple of times...",,,
,"Well, the one time I remember is that this little Chicanita, she...tiny, she was tiny. I don’t even think she weighed a hundred pounds. She was less than five feet. Um, and she called me at home. I was her counselor, EOP counselor. And she said she was at Emergency Hospital. And I go, “What are you doing there?” And she goes, “I tried to abort myself with a coke bottle and I...I’m hemorrhaging. I don’t know if I’m going to live.” I go...I don’t think I knew what an abortion was at that point. All this...you know, all these experience that I had, then I would go read about it, you know. So some help I was, right? So I go see her, and my remembrance is that her tiny hand is in mine, my big hand. And I’m the only one she has. Because she couldn’t tell her family. The dude was...had split. She couldn’t tell her friend. This was her secret, you know. And we all hopefully by now know about that secret. And, um, I go, “Do you want me to call your mom?” you know. She says, “No, no. They’ll disown me.” I said, “What about your boyfriend?” She says, “He’s already disowned me. He has nothing to do with it. He says it’s not even his.” And...and then she would plead with me, and she pleaded with me, “Ah, but it is his. This is my...I never had sex with anyone. You have to believe me.” I said, “It’s okay, it’s okay. I believe you. I believe it.” But she’s already like blaming herself for this and feeling it’s the end of the world, and really wanting to die. Wanting to die. Because she had, ah...she had broken the coke bottle in her uterus, and it had ripped it to shreds, so she couldn’t have any more children. And so she was like, “Why did they save me?” You know. “What am I going to do?” And, ah, all I could do was say, “It’s going to be okay.” I...I go, “You know, peop—women get pregnant, what...what...this wasn’t something you have to die for,” you know. “It wasn’t worth your life. You know, your life is worth more than, ah...more valuable than just what people think.” ",,,
,"So, um...then I had a couple other experiences similar. Some of them think they’re pregnant. But it was all around pregnancy and abortions. And then we started talking about birth control. “Oh, let’s not talk about birth control. We can’t do that. The church doesn’t accept it.” “Well, are we having sex?” “Well, just with my boyfriend.” “Okay, okay. Well, you know when you have sex, you can get pregnant.” “No, no, no, you only get...you only – what was it? – you only get...ah, when you get pregnant, it’s a gift from God. And so when it’s His decision and I know he won’t, because it’s not time,” you know. Yeah, so it’s kind of wishing, you know. This little wishing away pregnancy. ",,,
,"So then we started talking about how did...how do we get pregnant, when do we get pregnant, and...and what...what is birth control? What are some of the birth control that doesn’t work. Because if there was birth control it was a withdrawal, and that doesn’t work. And so we found out just why it doesn’t work, you know. And so we started reading Our Bodies, Ourselves. And then we said, whoa! We don’t know nothing. So all of a sudden...now, this might sound really silly. But all of a sudden, we were all interested in our cervix. What is a cervix? And, ah, why is this important. When is it different so that you do get pregnant, and you...and when it...when you don’t get pregnant? And then when we finally saw that pictures of the cervix, we said, oh, my God! A baby has to come out of that? You know. I mean, it’s just a little...just a little curly-cue, just a little mouth. It’s like the head of a penis, you know. And if a dude ever thought that that head of the penis was going to open up to bring out a baby, maybe he’d think twice, if he had any empathy for another, okay. That’s given, maybe, empathy. But, so then we go...baby comes out of that? That’s got to hurt! [laughter]",,,
,"So on this level we were learning about your bodies, you know, and about the cycle of the egg and sperm and how it can travel up the leg after you withdraw. And we were, it’s just amazing. Well, then they would talk to their boyfriends, or they would talk about it. They started talking about it in a mixed group in MEChA. “No, no, no, no!” you know. And then they wanted the guys to know so they could become responsible too, and there would be this joint decision as far as, you know, when you’re messing around, you know, having sex, or having a meaningful moment that you both understand what you’re...what the...when to do it, not to do it, and why it’s going to happen. But they weren’t interested in it. It was too embarrassing. They didn’t want to talk about it.",,,
,"Well, you know what? I, now, at this point, I didn’t know how much they knew about their body. It was only later that I thought, “You know, I wonder just how much they know, how comfortable they were in talking about their own body. Because if we are just learning, they probably didn’t know anything more than we did. So, um, and, you know, you’re often uncomfortable if people are talking about things you don’t know. You don’t want to show your ignorance. So...so I look back and I said, maybe that wasn’t just about men not wanting to be responsible and turning it off, but maybe it was had to do with, one, making them realize they didn’t know about themselves, and making them real—and...and being uncomfortable with the women knowing something that they didn’t know. They wouldn’t be on equal terms. ",,,
,"But I don’t know if that was true, you know. I often speculate why things happen. Ah, because, um...these are guys you know. They’re...they’re not like the “male” or the male establishment. These are guys you know. You’re the same age, you’re coming in at the same time, you’re growing up at the same time. And you’re going through those milestones, developmental milestones at the same time. So I figure the milestones we went through, they must have...probably were going through those milestones also, but without the curiosity or encouragement to, you know, hit those milestones. They weren’t...they weren’t going in that direction. ",,,
,"So that’s...that’s kind of like the background of how the woman’s thing is. So all these issues, then we started reading. Not just me, but the women in this...beginning of this...we called this (Hermanas Unidas 40:30). And it was the committee. We also made menudo, and we were the fundraising arm of MEChA. We raised money. Would, you know, make menudo and salads so that they could raise enough money for the newspaper to go out. Or, um, money to...I just remember for using for the newspaper. I don’t know what other roles we...we raised funds in. And so as these different issues came up, we would start reading.",,,
,"You know, unfortunately, we didn’t have a Google. So we couldn’t look up abortion, or birth control, or this or that. So we would figure out, well, where do we begin? And, you know, like the experience at the Emergency Hospital, I looked up abortion myself. I wanted to know what it was. What were the issues. I found out about...and abortion was still illegal at that point in California. And, ah, where is there help, there was underground help for people who had underground...unwanted pregnancies. So, and then, you know, we learned about (? 41:38) control. That’s how we found out about Our Bodies, Ourselves. We just would go to the library. We’d go to the bookstore. And there wasn’t a whole lot. You know, like you could find it easy. ",,,
,"And so then we even, um, would talk to...there was NOW. And we’d look at NOW, but...So NOW was talking about health issue—Oh, there was Ms., Ms. Magazine. And Ms. Magazine always had a section on health, birth control. And it tried to have something that was going on in the community, in the minority women’s community. Not always, but that was...that was a...a resource, in that they would tell us what the issue is. And then we would know more to go work about...work on it. And then...then the women would go and talk to their parents. They’d talk to their mothers, you know. When did they ever use birth control? Did they ever have an abortion? Ah, did they ever have a child out of wedlock? And it turns out mostly everybody got pregnant before they got married, they’re parents, right? And, this was...this was no shame, because they married the parents, they married the father, and they had twenty years later, you know, they’re still together. But abortion, or birth control, then they saw how, um-um, moms weren’t talking. Pops, “I don’t want to hear that in the house at all.”",,,
,"Ah...grandmothers, grandmothers would talk more than moms, you know. So grandmas were a...a key resource to the girls, okay. And they may or may...it depended on the grandmother. Some shared more than others. Ah, but then they realized, this isn’t just...I’m not just having these problems because I’m a college kid, okay. And I’m going, moving into the middle class. These are problems that my family has had. And because of those problems, it made a major difference in their lives, and it decided whether they did this or that. So that began to make them feel normal. There was always this need to feel normal. Because there was one, the guilt about being in college, you know. God, they had guilt about having to only share their bathroom, if they were in the dorm, they only shared the bathroom with one person, and they would think of their parents or their families, their brothers and sisters, you know. And so they had all these little luxuries that families didn’t. And they felt this guilt. So like, one more thing to feel guilty about. So very important to, you know, find out that they were still being normal. This was normal. This part of growing up as a woman and it happens to...it’s a common thing.",,,
,"And so once we started learning of that, then we started writing about it. We did more research. We would write about it. We’d write about it in the...in (? 45:09) Grande for MEChA...the MEChA newspaper, we would write about it. I started writing about it in La Raza newspaper. But it was just the writings really reflect a growing awareness. ",,,
,"So, um, so that’s...that’s how the woman question began, you know. It was really a men’s idea [laughs]. We may have done it or not, I couldn’t tell you, you know. But Corinne and I, we were...we wanted to make the organization a success, and the men felt that this was important, and we felt it was important. So we did it. Um, and as a result, that’s what came out. A long story.",,,
,I,It was a great story.,,
,I2,"Yes, it’s a good breaking point too.",,
,I,Yeah. Let’s break.,,
,I2,You want to ask another question?,,
,I,"No, we can break.",,
,I2,"I mean, were you going to...were you about to ask...?",,
,I,"Well, I...I just...No, I wanted to make a comment, that listening to your story, it’s so interesting to see the path. But you’ve got to stop...",,
,I2,I’ve got to go outside [laughter].,,
,I,You’re exiled.,,
,R,[laughs],,
,I,You’re out of this organization! [laughter],,
,I2,I think it has (? 46:22).,,
,R,She can put it on mute. Just put it on mute.,,
,I,"Yeah, put it on mute. Um...this shift, um, from the path to Concienticacion, right, which is first forming a caucus, understanding the issues, or beginning to understand the issues. And then, um, and...and learning, sharing amongst the women, and multi-generational sharing too, or not. And then reading. And then writing.",,
,R,Uh-huh.,,
,I,"And that is just very, um...it’s a very powerful story, actually. Um, and I’m very interested also in, you know, what texts become...really important key texts and Our Bodies, Ourselves, I was very surprised, and...and, you know, I find that very interesting that that’s the text that is sort of speaking to women. But it’s because if there’s one thing that is similar, it does unite women across different class and race lines, it’s this question of taking control of...of knowledge about your body.",,
,R,Um-hum.,,
,I,"And I was also very interested to hear your thoughts on men and how there’s...It struck me, I never thought of it before, but in the entire, you know, period of the women’s liberation movement, there is no...",,
,Part 2:,,,
,I,"So, um, you were talking about just now, Hermanas Unidas. And so what shifted from Hermanas Unidas, ah, to Las (? Gordano 00:32)? And how did that happen, that shift?",,
,R,"Well, it came from the research. Okay, it came from the research and writing, the need to write. At that time, there was the model that I learned in MEChA, and it was, again, even further reinforced in La Raza, is that there was the Chicano Press Association. And there was a need to write what was going on, and to get it printed, to share it with, you know, your...the...the specific audience. But also to disseminate it and to find out if the same things happen in other places. And, ah, Enriq—Enriqueta Vasquez always had a article in El (Greto 1:25) that addressed one woman’s issue or another. And it was so important to...Oh, that was the other thing is that, while in our research we would...there was...we always had access to Chicano press newspapers. They were always coming into the MEChA office. And we could see that this was...this was happening everywhere else – these questions, what the women were thinking, what the guys were thinking, what were the problems. And, ah, so we knew that the model for mobilization and raising awareness, and...we didn’t use the word self esteem, but a positive sense of self, and a sense of self determination, was to communicate with one another, and to communicate with men and women, you know.",,
,"                So I was doing...So we had talk about doing a newspaper, so that we could, um...just that women on campus, show their art, share their idea—we realized we needed to hear what women thought. Okay. So we wanted to share what we were learning, and also what we were thinking in a newspaper. Because that’s what we did in those days. And so, ah, we were doing different research. And this was a big step, just this idea. Because, one, the women would have to rebuilt themselves. I never under—I never went through that. I had no idea why other than, ah...it’s not the way my mother things or my aunt thinks, or...I don’t even remember my girlfriends thinking that in high school. So...so I didn’t have any empathy for that, because I didn’t go through that. You know, usually empathy comes from your own experience. But then I realized that...",,,
,"                So we had decided we’re going to put poems in. We’d like to put artists’ work in. We were going to put research articles in. We were going to put Chicana thought in, what they thought about whatever they thought, whatever issue they wanted to write about. And, um, so that we became rather than...we went from development and training to mobilization, really. But I didn’t...you know, we didn’t call it that, but looking back, that’s what I see it as. And so we each had our project. ",,,
,"And, ah, then I saw that, um, this was hard. This was...Even though the women...There were several stumbling blocks. One, to let other people know what they’re thinking. “Hm...I don’t know how I feel about that.” Women artists, you know, women who were going to be artists. Other people were going to be artists. Other people were going to see them ultimately. If you’re going to be artists, ultimately it’s going to be seen one way or the other. “Hm...I don’t know I’m ready for that,” you know. Ah, they all...so it was the issue of rebuilding themselves, having to face the consequences of it. Like artists, are they going to like what I wrote...what...my picture? You know. Nothing political. Just are they going to like it. My poems. It’s personal. You know, do...”What’s going to be the feedback, and how am I going to feel about it?”",,,
,"So we had to have constant communication just to encourage and support ourselves in completing the work, because there was...it was a new experience. You know, the only person who had seen our work is the teachers. You know, maybe not even our parents. So teachers are anonymous people. But when you actually put your name on it...So then they talked about using pseudonyms. Not everybody was ready to do that. So that was...that was stage one, getting there. And then stage two was deciding what they were going to write about. Stage three was going back to stage one. Oh, you know, do I really want to do it. ",,,
,"And then I had, um – I don’t remember how – but I had stumbled on this, um...book called...hah, I forgot. I told (May Lee 6:17). That was a hundred years ago. But there was this book on Mexico, Mexican history. And there was there a segment about the Flores Magon brothers. And in that, there was a segment totally on the women’s role during that revolution. And they talked about Hijas de Cuauhtemoc, and how they worked to support. And they were a supportive arm and a fundraising arm, and they also had a newspaper, a newsletter. And they were doing all kinds of things. And I was very excited, because, again, it makes us normal, you know. There’s this whole goal of trying to normalize who you are and what you’re doing. So we shared it. We talked about at one of our meetings. And we read it, and we were just like all bug-eyed, and...Because the feeling that you’re normal is such a wonderful feeling, you know [laughs]. And so, um, and it was very interesting, and we wanted to know more. And so we decided that, ah, we would use Hijas de Cuauhtemoc for the name of the newspaper. ",,,
,"We didn’t really call ourselves Hijas, okay? That was the name of the newspaper. Because we would be, ah...following in the footsteps of this organization. And that’s...So the...the newspaper was to commemorate and continue the work of Hijas de Cuauhtemoc. It was people who called hijas, okay? Only it wasn’t like Cuauhtemoc. So, um...so that’s how...how that...that came about. And so...and we...",,hijas,
,"So the first newspaper was about the women at Cal State Long Beach, who they were, what they thought, what their talent was, etcetera. And then the reception was absolutely negative. I would say tsunami. Tsu—complete rejection. Completely rejection. Personally, in the public life, in the private life. Just, you know...And everybody regretted having their names and their work represented. ",,,
,"Now I’ve got to tell you now, we’re talking about artwork that might be a portrait, you know. Um...hm, not a painting, but with pencil. I forgot what that’s called. But, you know, just a portrait of a face, a woman’s face. A hand [laughs]. I mean, very enigmatic kinds of stuff. Um, but it...it was traumatizing. It was traumatizing. Tsunamic trauma. Who are these hijas? What are you guys trying to do? What did you mean when you said this on this line? What is this picture all about? What did you mean when you said this on this line? I mean, you were on the carpet. And it’s like, you know, ah, looking at every work that President Obama says, you know, and asking for an explanation. Even the “uhs” you know. So, ah, it was...it was from ordinary hostile environment to super hostile environment. ",,,
,"Did we think of leaving? Nah, you know. These are the dudes, that’s the way they are, you know. Life goes on. So, um...then we...and we continued. We continued to work within the organization, be the fundraisers, have the meetings, do training, and Corinne and I tried to encourage the women to become public speakers. So they would, whatever they did research in, or if they just wanted to talk, we would give...we would say, “Whatever you want to do, when you...when we meet next time, who wants to speak?” Okay. And so you get experience. Because it’s not easy to speak in front of a group. But we all know each others. But it’s important. You have something valuable to say. ",,,
,"So we would practice public speaking. And being part of UMA, I mean, the EOP, ah, we would go speaking to Kiwanis Clubs, to, ah, Mexican American Senior Citizens Clubs. We would go to a lot of places to raise money for scholarships. So we would encourage them to come with us, and then to go on their own. And so we would try to do that kind of process of development.",,,
,"Then we heard about the National Women’s Conference in Houston. And we said, how can we go to that conference to talk about Chicana thought, and we don’t even know what we’re thinking around here? You know? I mean, we just found out what we’re thinking here in the campus. And that’s just a small group of women. We don’t know what everybody else is thinking – just the new Chicana students or this or that. Or the Chicanas from...is there a difference between those Chicanas who came from (Bisadia 12:06), and those Chicanas who came from East LA, you know. We could see that there’s all different diversity there among the women. And...and then, of course, we’re college women, you know, so that’s a very small segment. So what about other women? ",,,
,"So at that time, I had been...become working, and really being mentored by Francisca Flores and Regeneracion. And that whole group that she had. It was like, um...that’s as close as I think I ever came to a café society, where a group of thinkers – not thinkers – a group of people came to share about what they thought, what they questioned, and practiced it, you know. And see what...what...what it sounded like. And then we would continue that dialogue. And you’d be growing along that, you know. And so Francisca had that group of writers that she had established around herself. And the people who put out the Regeneracion. ",,,
,"So, um...so we through her influence, we said we got to organize at least a regional, Southern California Regional Conference, where as many different women come, and we have to make sure that as many different points of view are shared, you know. And, um...so we started...So everybody had...knew somebody somewhere at another campus or in the community. And so they start coming up with ideas for the workshop, and we start...we worked with the women in Cal State LA, Los Angeles City College, um...and women in the community. We had women’s...who were working with women in...who had come out of the prisons, who were working with women in the prisons. Welfare rights. I had been working with Alicia (Scalate 14:25). And so we had, um...you know, we wanted to have a welfare rights workshop, a women in prison workshop. And as many different kinds of workshop as there were people who...who we knew about that were working in different areas. Employment. And we had [clears throat]...",,,
,"And, um...ah, it was...it was on the weekend of Mother’s Day, I think. And I had my...I don’t know, my mom went. But my...both...two...both my grandmas went. And so I said, I dedicated, you know...you know, with being mushy, I dedicated this conference to them. And, you know, my grandma, Maria, sh—I really never ever knew how much English she really knew, you know. She...she made sure that people didn’t know...not...I don’t know about the family, but the public didn’t know whether she spoke Span—English or not. Understood English. She didn’t speak English. But my grandma did. My grandma, Theodora, my mom’s mom. And I don’t know what, but they were just there (being mean 15:39) and they were with each other of course, so they enjoyed each other’s company. And, ah, they had never gotten so much attention. And they were just, that was just precious. ",,,
,"But we had this workshops, all these workshops, and all of us, we didn’t know each other. You know, they...we met Cal State LA. Probably somebody knew somebody, right? Otherwise how they would connect. But we didn’t know everybody. It wasn’t a clique. It wasn’t a long time relationship where everybody was thinking the same thing. And so we all got together, got people...I think it was like the people from LA city who, ah, helped to organize the women in the prisons. But I don’t...you know, it’s too far back. But they each did their job, got the people in the organization. Got people to attend. And so we had a lot of people who attended, and I don’t remember. But it says in the newspaper how many people attended. And our goal was then to, ah, document what they felt were the issues concerning these different topics, and what they were doing in the different topics. ",,,
,"And that that way we would be prepared to go to, um, the women’s conference, and we would have something concrete to talk about. These are things that we’re concerned about. What about you? What...you know, and share it. Because we kind of thought they’d be doing the same thing. Because that was a very important tool, the newspapers. ",,,
,"And so...so we had the...the Hijas conference. And so we published that. And one of the big things was to see...for the first newspaper we raised money by, ah...oh, I think it was we sold menudo, we had a dances, and we raised money for the newspaper. And then the second newspaper for the conference to document what that was, that was a lot of labor. I mean, you had to listen to the tapes, you had to compare your notes. We had never done this before. And then, you know, like, summarize and list it, and, you know, does this really represent this and that? Can we reach those people to see if it’s okay? ",,,
,"Um, we didn’t have money for that. So then we had to raise money for that. Now, it wasn’t like a billion dollars. It was 250 dollars to print 7,000 copies, I think. And so we had to raise 250 dollars. And that was a lot of money. So then we would go speaking different places. And Cindy Ernesto, who was part of this group, her parents belonged to the, ah...Santa Fe Senior Citizen, and it was primary a Mexican-American organization. And so, um, ah, they were...my...I don’t know why it was at the Senior Citizen, because they were all my parents’ age. So these...they were not seniors. They were all working men and women. And so, ah, I went to talk to them to tell them what we were doing, and what...what our goal was and that we’re primarily advocating, to, you know, for, ah, young women to succeed in education, you know. And of course, um, two of their daughters were in our organization and they were very proud that what they were doing, you know, writing and...It was like such a different reception. The parents were proud of what their daughters were doing. And, um, the fathers were very, ah, not only proud, but they thought it was very important, because they would tell me, you know, “I see my daughter becoming an adult. And she’s going to...she’s beginning to practice to be an equal adult in this world. And it takes a lot. And I see her going in that direction, and I’m really proud of it. And I’m really proud of this organization, because it’s helping them do that, you know.",,,
,"And then they would...they would say, um, that how we would...but we’d talk about how we were treated in the organization, and they said, “Those are just boys. Those are just boys. They...they’re just going through growing pains.” Or “They’re men, men with mal educacion,” you know, they weren’t raised prop—appropriately, and maybe you’ll never change them. But that’s...don’t pay attention to them.” That was wonderful news, you know. That was wonderful news. And so they said, “Don’t worry.”",,,
,"Now...now I go to tell you this little story. When I went...they must have had pity on me also. Because when I went, I was wearing...I was cold. And I was wearing this jacket, and I was wearing long pants. And they all had holes in their...in their pockets. So I had money, change. And I would put it in this pocket, fall down, I’d pick it up. I’d put it in this pocket. Fall down, and...And so, you know, I was like a little povracita, I picked out also...I didn’t intend for that, but, ah, Cindy said, you know, that ev—it touched every mother’s heart [laughter]. But, um, the...the fathers and the mothers said, “Don’t worry. You don’t have to go try to raise money for this. We’ll have a fundraiser and we’ll get the money for you. You just work on getting it done, getting it finished. We’ll give you the money. And if you need any more money, let us know.” Like oh, (wow 22:34), that was great. Even right now, I get chills.",,,
,"And so, again, you know, to get that kind of support from people who, ah, are from your parents’...remind you of your parents and talking to you like your parents, and saying “This is a good thing,” that was good. That was good for me, and it was good for the other people.",,,
,"So...so with that, we raised money for the second issue of Hijas. And then...So then the next thing was to get a group of people to go to this conference. [break]...have to have more drivers. I think get...everybody’s got this car knew how to drive. And, ah, so that was a big...a big requirement. If you’re going, you know, that’s a low way. We need everybody to know how to drive. ",,,
,"So I think the way it turned out, only one person didn’t know how to drive that came with us, I think.",,,
,"Okay, next thing is to tell your parents you’re going to go to Texas, on your own, and, ah...I’m not asking, I’m saying, “This is what I’m going to do.” Ooh! You know. That would be another major obstacle. “What! How am I going to reach you?” You know, this was no cell phones, no nothing. You know, they’d be gone and you wouldn’t hear from them until you arrived or, you know. And not every parent had a phone. Okay? So, ah, so that was a separation, an individuation, milestone for the women, um, with their families. And a lot of them, the family said no, you can’t go. And the women went anyway. So that was like going on a major trip, having defied your parents. That never felt well. You know, growing up is never feel...really feels good. So they would have that (?) on their stomach. “I got to do good. You know, I’ll be okay. I think I could do it,” you know. “I want to show my parents I can do it.” ",,,
,"But not only that, but say, “If you go, don’t come back.” Lot of...lot of threats, that, you know...things were worked out when they came back. But nevertheless, this was like the...the incentive or the disincentive not to go. [break] ...dependent woman, was a woman of loose morals, and so maybe that’s...maybe that’s what this meant. But it was very symbolic in that cultural context. Maybe that was what it meant. But, ah, the women said, “Okay, you’re going to go without my permission? I release you. And you’re no your own.”",,,
,"So that blew her away. And I didn’t realize how much it blew her away. Um, and so she started having a psychotic break on the trip over there. Now I can tell you it was psychotic break. But I had no idea it was a psych—I don’t know at this time. I don’t know what a psychotic break is. I don’t know what the manifestation is or why. Um, so...so when sh—when we’re driving...So we’re going out and we decided to drive at night so it’s cooler, okay? To go across the desert at night. And the women weren’t comfortable driving at night. I had driven to New Mexico several times on my own. So I said, okay, I’ll drive the first...the first league. And so [laughs] another woman, “Now, when are we supposed to sleep?” So somebody would ride...drive afterwards, right? ",,,
,"Well, we’re driving at night across the desert, you know. Very...very...they started remembering all the spooky stories that they were ever raised up with. And one of the spooky stories is this man, the hitchhiker, you know. I think maybe there was the...the thing on Twilight Zone. There’s similar parallels in Mexican or folklore that they were raised with, similar to the hitchhiker. And that had been on Twilight Zone, so it was fresh in their minds. And so they were looking and looking, you know, and...It was...they were scared, you know. It was mind-blowing. Their fantasies got out of hand. And so when we would drive or we’d pull over and get gas, you know, I’d look at everybody, and everybody was like this...[laughs] real hyper-vigilant. Real hyper-vigilant. And then they would talk about like, you know, the different stories that they used to hear when they were children. But now this is the real thing and they can’t...they were trying to shut it off, shut their mind off. So we put the radio on. But, you know, in the desert there’s no too much, you can’t get too much. But we got the [laughs]...we got the Navajo station, you know [laughs]. And that wasn’t very comforting, you know. That wasn’t very comforting at all. That was kind of like outer spacey too. ",,,
,"So, ah, so, you know, that was a (going 28:25) thing. But, um...so I made my change, and so I went to sleep, I could...like I was dead to the world. And so while I was sleeping, then I woke up. It was daylight again, and I opened my eyes and I looked around. And the girls are still like this, you know. They were more hyper-vigilant. And I turned around and I go, because I’m a pretty sleep kids. It takes me a long time to actually wake up. And I look and I go, “What’s going on?” And each one of them look at each other like this, you know. And I go, “Oh, they just have to get used to traveling.” And tshcha....went out. So then when I finally was able to wake up, they were all the same way. And I go...so when we pulled over at some gas station, and to get some ice and some drinks, then, you know, I start talking, “What’s going on? What’s going on?” And...and, um, they say, there’s a lot of bizarre stuff going on while you were asleep. Lot of bizarre stuff. And evidently, um, this young girl, poor girl, she was verbalizing her psychotic symptoms, you know, that people were trying...that people were trying to...the girls were trying to...She was accusing them of trying to leave her, you know. And just all kinds of...like she disappeared through the car, and she was way back there, and they had to back and go pick her up, you know. So there were a lot...I don’t know what else, you know. Because they didn’t want to tell me, for whatever reasons, you know. For whatever reasons. Maybe they were just reluctant to talk about it, like what are you going to do? ",,,
,"So, um, so I felt like it was their job to take care of her, and it was our job to drive and get there. So another incident that happened on...where already we’re in Houston. We’re in big old freeways. I mean, you know, pffffttt...I mean, made California freeways look...were a shame. I mean, they were...what?, four lanes, maybe larger. And I had been sleeping. And I was sitting on the shotgun side. And there was like...we were really crowded. I don’t remember how many of us, but there was me, somebody else, and the driver. Maybe two of us...two people, me and the driver. And, um, (Letty 31:13) was the driver. And she wasn’t used to driving for such a long time. And she was, you know, to go so fast. She wasn’t used to driving on a freeway to go so fast. So she was like this, you know. And I’d look at her and I’d say, “Are you doing okay, Letty?” “Uh-huh. Uh-huh. I’m doing fine. Yeah. Yeah. Go to sleep Anna, go to sleep,” she’s been...And I could see her heart, like a cartoon [makes beating noise] [laughter] But she was brave and she was sticking through it. But, um, so I must have been like this. So I turned around and I got cozy and I opened the door. So then I proceeded to fall out, you know, chiii!, and I see these lines. Oh, just like those lines on the cover. I see these lines on the freeway, you know. And then somebody gets me like this, and closes the door, and it’s kept us...it’s (Mysevit 32:08), it’s (Cata’s) sister. And, ah...I’m still asleep, right. So, you know, she...she was quick and she saved me. And so I’m going, “What? What just happened?” And I look at everybody, and everybody is like hyper-vigilant to the twenty-third power. God, these girls are going to lose their eyes! I mean, they just kept on getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger. So then we stop. It’s my turn to drive. And, ah, the girls tell me that this young woman had said that I was going to fall out of the car. And they were blown away. Because I almost did fall out of the car [laughs]. And it was at night. And so several hours has passed before this came. And so they were blown away, you know. They say, you know, “There’s something mystical about this trip. Wasn’t really meant to be. What’s...are we going to make it home? Are we ever going to make it home?”",,,
,"So then we go to the conference. We find...we find the YWCA and, um, it was in a barrio. Was obvious it was a barrio. You know, it wasn’t in a middle class community. And, um, it was big. Because [break]...I, ah, it set me on a path. I didn’t know it, but it set me on a path, and that ultimately was to teach Chicano Studies, to develop a curriculum and teach Chicano Studies.",,,
,"So then I don’t know if it was the second day. There was this group of women from UCLA who were organizers. And they...they knew how to disrupt and divide. And...and they were very charismatic, in particular, one very charismatic. She’s even more charismatic now. Ah...what’s her name? Well, anyway, she has charisma, like, you know, when you see...a Mexican singer. She wasn’t like...she reminded me of some Mexican actress. Or many Mexican actress. But she was dramatic, and she had oomph, and she was interesting and I liked her voice too, you know. And, ah, not everybody sounds good when they’re yelling, you know. But she could project, and that voice was still solid. And she says a couple of words, like, um...oh, gosh, how can I forget? Anyway, she...she says something like, um, she criticizes us for being at the YMCA...YWCA. And she said somebody...somebody else said something about criticizing the food that we were, um...we were...that we had hot dogs, and what kind of Mexican food was that. And I said, that’s got to be (Allay 35:39), you know, only Allay is there protocols for what Mexican eat. ",,,
,"So, um...and I...and I knew, I know these women. And I knew right away what they were doing. They were setting up to sabotage it, and divide it. Because they were good, and I had seen them in action before. And, ah, I said, “Oh, no, they’re going to organize to stop the conference.” And so I turned to Petita, and I said, “Petita...” Petita didn’t know me. Okay, I didn’t know...I mean, I knew who she was. She didn’t know who I was. But we were sitting next to each other. I said, “How do we stop them?” And she goes, “Why should we stop them?” you know, she...she...I don’t think that it had dawned on her what they were doing, that this was tactical. It wasn’t a woman voicing her opinion, it was a tactical move. And so she lays a guilt trip on the women, saying “Here we are being selfish,” which, God forbid that it’s going to be selfish, talking about ourselves when our men were dying in Vietnam, when our people were being shot at on the...during the Reconquista, the March from Imperial Valley to Fresno, I think, the farm workers. And doing all these other major struggles, and here we’re talking about ourselves, and shame on you. And what we should really be talking about is moving issues. And those people who agree with me, we should walk out of the conference right now and we’ll be meeting in this park across the street.",,,
,"And I go...I didn’t think...While she was talking and I as turning around looking at people, there were too many women going...agreeing with them. There was just too many women, you know. And I go, “Oh, my God! We got to stop this. This is...this is too value...we’re wasting our time. And so everybody – not everybody – but quite a few people, you know, get up enough to disrupt and stop the forum that was going on, and start walking out. And...",,,
,Part 3:,,,
,W,Because they got up on me.,,
,R,"Oh, sorry.",,
,W,It is okay. Okay. Go ahead.,,
,I,"So, ah, when last we met [laughter]...we were talking about the ’71 conference. And the other day, you know, or yesterday, actually, when I was talking to (Elee 00:48), she...she had commented to us that, um, that what happened in ’71 may have prevented or stopped or stalled the momentum for a national...really, a truly national organization or coalition of Chicana organizers and thinkers. And then you said, when we...right when we were finishing up that, um, the women...we were talking a little bit about women who walked out of the conference. And you’d said, Oh, I’d seen them in action before.",,
,R,Um-hum.,,
,I,And that was something I was very curios about. So you already...you had a sense that the walk-out was more disruptive or divisive organizing gesture.,,
,R,Right.,,
,I,"So when you say you’d seen them in action before, I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit and...",,
,R,"Well, ah [sighs] in...well, they were from Los Angeles. And in Los Angeles, there were people of different persuasions, ideological persuasions. And they competed for support. And, um, there were various tactics that they used to sabotage, you know, people that they opposed, to stop it. Or to even, like it was also the tactics that would be used in a...in community meetings, or meeting with school boards, or meeting with different representatives of the institutions to try to get them to hear that they’re...they’re following the wrong point. But generally, it was...it’s where there’s competitive ideas and you want to...you’re in competition with the same community support. We want to get them to side with you. And so it was just typical, just typi—I mean, you see it in the gangs. I mean, it’s not new. It’s not new. No.",,
,I,"And after that meeting, you went home. I’m assuming you’ve made that big drive home, back home. How...how did you...do you remember how you felt in the car and how people felt in acheesement [sic], just to sort of general acheesement [sic] once you got back, and the kind of after-effect of that really important historical conference? ",,
,R,"Well, the women who, ah, tried to stop the conference had gone back and told several of the community leaders who were against it – they weren’t community leaders, they were academic leaders – that they had stopped it. And so, when we came back everybody said, “Ha, ha, you know, that...we heard that the Chicano conference was a fiasco and it...and it ended in nothing.” I’m like, “Oh, nope, it wasn’t...it didn’t stop. It didn’t end in a fiasco. Yeah, there were some disruptions but we went on with it.” Um, and so they were kind of curious about that. ",,
,"Now, they held on to that story, that it was a fiasco and nothing happened because nothing...the...the follow-up of the conference didn’t materialize. Okay. A few people wrote down what the workshops were and some of the resolutions. Ah, like (? 4:32) Chavez and Sonya Lopez wrote an article which they published in the Ms. Magazine, which was really great. So that reached a larger community. Um, we wrote something on it. Um, but I don’t remember where we published it. We more verbalized it. Though we...we put it in, uh...",,,
,I,La Raza. ,,
,R,"Maybe it was La Raza. I don’t remember. But anyway, um...but all along I was thinking, okay, now comes the work of publishing what went on at Houston. So, um, I contacted people who had organized it and then I...you know, I said, “Okay, you know, what are we going to do? What can I do to help you? We can...uh, we can raise money and use this newspaper or we...we could be one of the newspapers that write down the...the...what the workshops are, what came from the workshops, and all of this.” And it was at that time that I found out that there wasn’t intention of doing anything more because, one, the organizers were pretty much in shock from...from those...that minority group that derailed the organ—the part of that organization. They...they really were in shock. And they were very hurt. They were very angry. And they felt that best to put their energy towards their community than to try...that it wasn’t...it was too early yet to...to kind of work in a national basis. And...but I think there was also a lot of emotional, um, pain that went there. And it was real hard to talk about it. So if you can’t talk about it, it’s hard to get it down, or there’s no motivation to get it down because you relive it, and you relive it. And, um...uh, each time you talk about it, it brings up the pain again, and the anger, and really wondering, what was that all about?",,
,"And, uh, so the organizers who really were key to putting out the follow-up were really suffering from shellshock. And be—and I don’t...after that, the rest of the women who met, from all over the United States, we didn’t have a means to communicate, so I don’t know if they went back shell-shocked as well. Because the women that we went with, um, a lot of them felt like, “You know, there’s more to life than this. You know, I...I’m pretty much tired of getting pooped on all the time. You know, I...I got, I...I...I’d...I’d rather be somewhere and achieve things where I’m appreciated. And if there’s all this negative stuff...it’s only in a small part of the world. The world is bigger than that.” ",,,
,"So, the...so, it is...it...there wasn’t a network that was setup. Well, see, that’s the other thing, is that the, um...the sabotage reduced the time that we all had to network, to go home with names and addresses. Because, you know, there was a lot of people there. And, uh, there was a lot to absorb. So there were the ideas. There were the net—connections, networking. ",,,
,"But there wasn’t enough time to do it. And the resources of the people who had organized, they didn’t have...their resources were like over—overextended. So...and we had so little time and so little money ourselves. We had to get home because we...we didn’t have the...the resources to stay longer. Like for instance, even though I met your mom, we didn’t talk, okay? Even though I was sitting next to Betita Martinez, we didn’t talk. And, uh, there were so many...even Francisco was there. And we didn’t talk. I mean, so, that’s real critical when such a conference comes together, where people actually connect, and talk, exchange phone numbers, or...it...we didn’t even have a...because almost all the women brought some kind of communication to...newspaper or newsletter, and shared it, you know. And we didn’t get them all. As a matter of fact, I only remember getting the...the Puerto Rican one. What is that called? ",,,
,I,Um...,,
,R,What...,,
,I,...the Young (? 9:40) Party...,,
,R,Yeah. ,,
,I,...paper? ,,
,R,The...,,
,I,It’s called the...,,
,R,Anyway...,,
,I,...I don’t know what it’s called [chuckles]. ,,
,R,"...uh, and we got a...we got something from Texas and we got, uh, something else. But, uh...but...so it...it...the...the...that’s important in a conference, that those logistics be setup, even if it’s just seats. Okay? But that wasn’t setup. We had all went back to a...continue...uh, attempt to disrupt, to organize. ",,
,"Ah, we had...before we had gone to, um...to the conference, there at Cal State Long Beach, the, uh, (machestas? 11:23) had hung me and (? deCortemac 11:27) in effigy. They had this whole...they had the teatro, um, perform this mass. And then they had three coffins. And they...they walked these coffins to the outside of the metro trailer and they...and they set them down. And they had a...a...a little tombstone that said “(Ijas te quatemoc 11:54) in the name of each...who...” They identified three names, you know, mine, Corinne’s, and...and (Letty’s 12:02). And then, um, they had a, uh...a dummy, a pa—a gunnysack dummy hung in effigy and that said Anna Nieto Gomez. ",,,
,"Now, you know, if that isn’t a hate crime, what is, right? And that kind of much tells you the hostility. And...and that, you know, turned a lot of people away. And (Ichas 12:29)...the women who were writing the (Ichas 12:32) newspaper, this was just before the Chicano conference, were ready to throw the...the book in because they were...you know, it was a rejection. ",,,
,"I saw who did it. I understood the politics. But I didn’t get angry any, you know, (sonsa me 12:51). I didn’t see it as a hate crime. I just saw it as a stupid, stupid act of people I didn’t have time to, ah...to deal with, because I had more important things to do. I already was having visions of finishing...of the organizing the conference. And then I was thinking we...I was thinking, even at that time, we’ve got to do something better than the...the, sh...the newspaper. We got to organize something more formal. And, you know, I had my mind toward...I had a vision of writing Chicana thought. That was the only thing on my mind. These are fools. Fools will do what fools do. But we have a vision and we need to...there is such a thing as Chicana thought. We’re going to have a regional conference on Chicana) thought. That’s going to be exciting. I wonder what all that is. We’re going to have a national...I wonder what all that...And we need to organize it and have it in a formal way, going on all the time. ",,,
,"So, I didn’t recognize what it was, you know. But it was very traumatic on everybody else. I was just too oblivious, you know. I tend to be that. It’s often a very positive thing. Ah, but I was just...I...I saw who it was and I said, “Oh, these (mensas 14:16).” But I only l—later, when I lost my job at Cal State Long Beach...I mean, at Northridge...then I remembered back to that time. And then I said, “You know...” Because, when I lost my job at Cal State Northridge, they had, ah, vandalized more door, or the office. They had vandalized my door and ha—they had put, “Puta...” I have a...I have a slide of it. But they put all kinds of horrible things on it. ",,,
,"And then, uh, I was making a slideshow on history of the Chicana. When I lost my job I wanted to...to get more information out. And then I was thinking about that effigy and I said, “Silly me. Why didn’t I take a picture of it? Why didn’t I see it as a hate crime?” Because this is the same thing. It’s just a repeat of the same thing. “Why did you set yourself up one more time?” Um, and, ah, you know, a dummy hanging with your name on it is...is a act of violence. You know, it’s definitely a message. What would have happened if you had stayed there? You know, uh, what would have happened to the women if they had stayed there? I go, “Oh.” I go, “Wow, good thing you didn’t know you were facing the Tiger [chuckles] because it just go somewhere else.”",,,
,"And I don’t know. But, you know...you know what it is when you see a hate cross or a burning cross, or whatever. And a dummy with your name on it, hung in effigy, is no small thing. So, ah...but the most important thing was getting Chicana thought out. You know, because there is a very diverse Chicana thought. And it’s so full. And, um, I wanted it to be a body of knowledge. And this is the way I thought I it could do. ",,,
,I,"And so you went and...after ’71, you’re still at Long Beach in the EOP...in the EOP office? ",,
,R,Um-hum. ,,
,I,"When do you make the...the switch to Northridge, and if you...if you can also sort of I guess talk about how your strategy...because I’m assuming you continued forward with this mission of trying to get Chicana thought out. Did the regional conference happen? There was one more issue of (Ichas 16:51), is that right, that came out after that? So what is the progression forward to...",,
,R,Well...,,
,I,...get to Northridge? ,,
,R,"Well, we did the thir—it...at...well, I was still in Long Beach. We did the third, uh, issue, which had, ah, the little that we had about the...the Women’s National Conference. And then, um, I was teaching the EOP student at that time. And then I c—I didn’t have a job there anymore. And I, ah...just left. I was looking for jobs. So I had various jobs. And I got a job as a...as a teacher at Cal State Northridge, in Chicano studies. And I was hired by Carlos (Arse 17:41). And I said, “You know, yeah...” He says that, “We are gla—great to have you here.” And I said, “I want to teach Chicana Studies.” I said, “That means I want to teach four classes on the Chicana. Not one, four.” He says, “Do you have curricula for all of that?” And I go, “No, but there is...if there...there’s got to be a lot there, you know. It’s just like Chicano Studies. It’s there. You just have to organize it, and put it together, and encourage people to do research.” So, he says, “Well, you know, I hope you are able to do it.” He says, “You won’t be able to do...teach four right away. But you can build and work towards that.” ",feminista,chicanostudies
,"So once he hired me, that, ah...um...um, then I put my mind towards...all we...we did was the third issue of (Ichas 18:30). And once I realized that there was nothing more going to come out of the Houston conference...like I think it’s two pages...four pages, you know, on each side. It was...it was very small. And I...I...you know, it didn’t even reflect much. And it was just what we brought back. So...and I talked to some of the organizers there and I saw that this is not going to happen. So I thought, well, we’re going to have to interview those people and write it. And, uh, we...we can use it as part of my Chicana Studies classes. So the first class I taught was Contemporary Issues of the Chicana. ",,,
,"So I started putting a syllabus together. And, um...and the...the core of it would be what I knew was going on in LA. You know, I...I had been working with women in welfare riots, with Francisca and employment. I’ve been working San Fernando Valley with setting up a childcare center, so that the women could go to adult ed or to junior college. Um, and what—and whatever else was coming from Chicano Press. ",,,
,"Chicano Press was the...my foundation for these articles written by women. And...and, ah, I talked to Corinne and...and, ah, Adelaida. And, uh, there was another woman, Isabel (Novar 20:01). She was...taught at...at Cal State (Dominguez 20:04). And she was a...we have one of her articles. And I talked to them about the need to not just have a short article but research...more developed ideas to put us together. You know, and definitely, if I’m starting a Chicano class here, other people are probably doing it. And we need, um, materials, collected materials. And so it’s at that time that I, uh...we came upon talking about a journal, okay, something more developed. And so Corrine and I had done various statistical stuff, like women in education. I had some stuff that Elisia...she hadn’t written, but I interviewed Elisia on welfare rights. ",,,
,"So we had these different kinds of pieces that were unfinished. And we decided we would finish them and put it in the first journal. And so we typed it out on the old manual typewriters. Corrine was the only one who really knew how to type good, you know. So it’s very sloppy. It wasn’t justified, I mean, we didn’t even know how to justify it. And so we put it together, taped it, and...and had it published. And we got a...an artist to do the cover. ",,,
,"And then, um...and when we looked at it...and I looked at it and I said, “This isn’t even a good term paper. We need something better than this, you know. Ah, and we need to spend more time. It’s not something you’re going to do in a couple of weeks or anything. You need time to develop the thought, to talk about it, to research, to let the ideas kind of...uh, come together and go in a certain direction, and process...be processed. ",,,
,"And so, then I asked, um, Adelaida, Isabel Novar. Ah, I did some piece—oh, I did the...the Feminista. Oh, and I wanted to write about the labor force, so I think I did that. And Elisia was trying to get...raise people’s awareness about the Talmadge Amendment, the workfare amendment for welfare rights. So, I worked with her to get a piece together so that this would be a more...more in-depth analysis, um, about things that people wouldn’t ordinarily know about. ",,,
,"And so, Adelaida had already had some ideas about the writing about, uh, (malitsin 23:17). And we had been talking about it. I had known her for a couple of years. And we had been talking about it. And she took more interest in it, and she was doing more research, and she was finding out about it. And, um, we talked and talked, and then I asked her if she would...uh, write the piece, write a piece for...to...to publish it. And, you know, yes-no, yes-no, but she was really, really getting very interested in it, and writing, and reading more research. And the more she read the more, ah, committed to it. ",,,
,"So she did a lot of research, a lot of idea development. And a lot of conversation went on. So then she started to write it, to put it together. And then, you know, she would put it aside, she didn’t want to do it. So then that’s the role of the editor, is to, you know, support the writer, and, hear the ideas, hear the reasons why, ah, and get them back on track. Because it is their baby’s. It’s...the baby’s being difficult at the time, you know. And, ah, so you quiet the baby, and soothe the baby, and eventually, you know, mom wants to take care of the baby again, right? ",,,
,"So, Ah...and...and so we did that. Isabel Novar not so much, but still, it was a matter of...because she was taking a chance. She was a academician at Cal State Northridge, so to write something for (In Quintro 24:44) was taking a risk, right? It wasn’t academic and it wasn’t in, um...even though she was in Chicano Studies, Chicano Studies wasn’t too crazy about these ideas. ",,,
,"And then, ah, so...then, you know, I worked with different people to put mine out. And I think Feminista was the last thing that I wrote after I did the others becau—and that came from the heart. That didn’t come from research or anything. That just came from the heart. Because, um, after I talked to Alma Barrera and s—and saw and felt the, um...the damage that this sex discrimination had...it had on her, and those women who work so hard, I just got...I just...that...I said, we, you know, we’ve got to call a spade a spade here, and let’s...let’s talk about what this is and how damaging it is. ",,,
,"So...and then Francisca helped me and she said, “I suppose you’re going to type this, huh, with your infamous typing skills?” So then she told me, ah, that with (Riha and Naracion 26:06) that she used this guy who justified. And I go, “What’s justified?” And she says, “Well, I had...do you notice how my...I have two columns and how they’re so nice and neat, you know, and the print is so pretty and handsome, and calls to the reader to read?” “Oh [sighs]. Well, I’ll...I’ll buy new ribbon.” She goes, “No, no, that won’t make it look any better.” So, uh, she hooked me up with him. He told me how much it was going to cost to justify it. And so, then we proceeded to raise money. Um, and what happened was I think, ah, I got a...a check...for some job, some job in Santa Monica. Uh, that’s when I found out what was happening in the prisons. Ooh. Ooh. Um, and I don’t remember what that job was but, ah...and that...that went for putting out (27:04 En Quentro). So I was so excited because we were going to have, you know, something to pass out to the women in...in...in the, ah...in...in my Chicana class, you know. It was so wonderful. Uh, but it was a lot of work. You know, it didn’t come out ‘til about a year and a half later. Because it took a year to kind of nurse the ideas, let them, you know, sit, and grow, and process out, and then getting the writing out. Then you have to write it out. But the ideas have to...well, depending on how each writer thinks. You know, some people, they write, and research, and then think. Each person is different...because they had, you know, their own full-time job or full-time life that they have to take care of. And reading...writing and research does take a lot out of your life, especially if you aren’t being paid for it. ",,,
,I,And that was in nineteen seventy...was it ’73 or ’74? ,,
,R,’73 is when the (? 28:12 En Quentro) came out. ,,
,I,Your first (? 28:14 En Quentro). And then there was a second one the following year. ,,
,R,"Yeah, that was a pretty one. That was just...that was the most professional one. And that came out in ’74, you know. And that’s what we, um...we...through the...again, through the Chicano Press Association, uh, we let everybody know that...that this was there. We sent out...I don’t know what we sent out, maybe flyers. And, uh...uh, and then before you knew it, schools, uh, colleges were asking for copies and stuff like that. And somewhere in between there Martha put her book out. So, I have a book for my [chuckling]...for my, uh...for my class. Halleluiah, God. God, praise...praise the Lord, you know! We have to canonize her [laughs]. And then, when I was reading it, and I go, ah, I’ve been...I’ve...I’ve been playing with that, you know, about (Diosas 29:13) and...and...but I haven’t had time to go into it. And I really, really wasn’t able to go into it ‘ti—uh, until, um, the summer that...before I was fired, you know. And then, once I was unemployed for that horrible, horrible desert of a time where I wasn’t employed, that’s when I was more able to, uh, look into it. ",,
,"But you really need time. And...and...and, um, I, uh, was too isolated. Like I didn’t think of calling Martha and talking about it. You know, that would have made...I think that would made a major difference. I mean, I might have even gone over there. But, you know, I was just...when you’re depressed you isolate yourself and it sucks. Ah, but, ah, I look back, and I look back, and I go, you know, um, there could have been...I...I...I didn’t stop. You know, I made the slideshow, I went on speaking, I wrote. Um...uh, I...I continued to write. When I went to San Bernardino, eventually, a couple years later, I found a job. And, uh, a magazine was coming out of San Bernardino called (Somos 30:31). And so, uh, I met them and I said, “I’d like to, uh, do some, uh, articles. You know, I can’t...can’t stop writing.” Because once you stop writing you can’t go back. Um, so I wrote...ah, I tried to write an article for each one of their volumes. And so...but I was still isolated. I still was, ah, like, spinning in outer space. And I didn’t connect. And I think if I had been able to connect at the national conference, ah, where we didn’t have time, you know, it was just too crazy, I think I...I could have, uh, reeled myself in sooner than later. [Chuckles] ",,,
,I,Do you feel comfortable talking about what happened at Long Beach...,,
,R,Cal State Northridge? ,,
,I,"...Cal State...Cal State Northridge. Because there’s a very short period...you know, it’s like the time from...moving from (31:45 En Quantro Feminin) to that period, which is pretty short. So, I’m wondering what...you’re there, you’re teaching classes on La Chicana. For how many semesters were you able to do that? ",,
,R,"Well, I was, uh, at Cal State Northridge for six years. ",,
,I,Oh...,,
,R,I taught...,,
,I,...so you were...,,
,R,"...six years. Six years. Um, in the beginning, I taught, um, the Mexican American Family, Urban Studies. I...I used, ah, Guzman’s book, The Mexican American. Um, A La Familia. I always changed books on that one. I never really found something that...that was...I could use again. And then, um, I taught Barrio  Studies and, ah, Contemporary Issues of the Chicana. And then that was the first year. And then the second year I added...ah, I...I added, uh, History of the Chicana. And then the...no, no, no, I must have...I must have added History of the Chicana the third year. And then going on the fifth year, I had an Independent Studies class. And those were st—that was...um, I told the students, you know, who had taken my other classes that if they were interested in doing a History of Third World Women’s Class, that to help me do research to look at the history of the America...or the United States from a global perspective. And they were...they were all excited about it. ",,
,"So I had a very big class. And, um...uh, we had to talk about, okay...uh, we had to look at the history of the United States, that...that...that, um, we hadn’t looked at in...in a way. We had to look like at migration patterns. And, uh, depending on what country people were coming from, they, uh...there were certain times when women came by themselves for certain reasons. But there were certain things happening in the country. So there was the cultural aspect, what was happening in the country that brought them to the United States, how they came. And, ah, that effected what...you know, what was happening...what’s happening now. And so we wanted to Asian women, African women, um, Mexican women. And that was...that was pretty big. But, ah, a...a lot of my students were Anglo women, and, um...or European American, because found out, you know, I have a (? 34:43) from England. And they say, “Oh, my parents aren’t from England. My parents are from Servia [sp.] or Yugoslavia, or whatever. And I go, “Oh, I’m still so dumb.” I thought...",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"...okay. And I said, “What do...do you...do you want to include that? Do you want to know why...wh—if there was a migration of women, and the history, and what were the economic conditions then, and their cultural and economic (? 35:11). And they said they would, even though, you know, it wasn’t third world women. And I said, “Well, you know, when it comes to immigration to the United States, I would imagine everybody fall into that category [laughs]. Because very few rich people wanted to come to the United States... ",,
,I,[Laughs]. ,,
,R,"...um, or had to come. So, first they had to do history on...oh, pick their region that they...and it usually had something to do with where their parents were from. You know, they were Asian women. Depending, if they were from, ah, a province in China, or where...or maybe they only...only knew about Honolulu or what happened...when it came to Honolulu. So they...each individualized it to their own personal...",,
,"So they had to find out, ah, migration dates. And that was pretty hard, as far as, uh, immigration dates, ah...ways into the United States by women, okay? And so some of the women said, “You know what? We start looking at the history of immigration laws. Sometimes it’s very specific.” And so that was a big old project. That took...that took most of that semester. ",,,
,"And then the next semester, um, I forget what we were going to do. But they had denied me tenure and, ah...So I’ll talk about, uh, what happened then.",,,
,"Um...okay, um, there were a lot of things going on, but in the beginning, I was...I felt supported in Chicano Studies. I always got outstanding evaluations, always. Ah, but when, uh...and again, you know, my obliviousness...I don’t know when I began to not be...uh, that...that, um, Chicano Studies wasn’t comfortable with me. So, these are my...my...my statements of when my awareness thinks it happened. ",,,
,"One of the things is that, um, in my Contemporary Issues class, there were a lot of gay and lesbian men and male students...female students, Chicanos, who would take my class. And they were very...ah, they w—they...I don’t know if they came out in my class. I doubt it. But they had already been out. But they came to my class and they would talk. They’d say, you know, “I’m a gay male,” or, “I was a lesbian,” and, you know, “I really identify with these issues because the same applies to us.” And, ah...ah, they took a risk to announce their sexual orientation in Chicano Studies because, you know, their butt was still going to be kicked, and they knew it. ",,,
,"All right, so there’s a lot of violence at that time, ah, more so what was accepted. Now it’s not political correct. It may still happen. But it was the right thing to do at that time. So they were taking their lives into danger. But being vocal and coming out, so visible. And then they’d be visible in the other classes they took in Chicano Studies. And several faculty didn’t like that. So the same thing that happened with...you know, when we were organizing the women, and they would ask me, oh, “What did this, uh, female mean when she says this?” They were then...I was in the Chicano Studies meetings. “What are you doing? The...you know, these homosexuals are coming out, and coming to Chicano Studies. We have nothing to do with homosexuals and...” And [chuckles] I go, “They’re students enrolling in our classes. You know, that’s what they’re doing there. And they’re good for Chicano Studies because you’ve got FTE.” ",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"And they didn’t like that. You know, they didn’t like that at all. Um...ah, but if they...I don’t remember them stating me very specifically why or what, but they definitely didn’t want me promoting, ah, study into gay and lesbians studies. But, you know, students write about what they’re interested, and who they are, and that’s what they would do. And they felt that since they could do it in my class, they could do it in the other classes, which wasn’t necessarily so. So they didn’t like that. ",,
,"Then, um, those who took my class, which were both men and women Chicanos and Chicanas, European Americans, and Afro Americans, and some Asians, and even some of the teachers at Cal State Northridge, outside of Chicano Studies, took my class. So, then, ah, with what they were learning in my class, they would ask the professors for information about women, or that...that topic, as related to what the professor would be relating. And the professors would say, you know, “We don’t know,” or, “That’s not true,” or, ah, you know...uh, they...they didn’t like those questions because they didn’t usually know. Okay, so, you know, a professor doesn’t like to be asked questions they don’t know about.",,,
,"So that created [sighs], ah, uncomfortableness. And that kept on happening on and on and on. And so, the...I think the students start becoming a little bit more assertive and expecting more from their Chicano Studies professors, expecting them also to include the story of the Chicana and the Chicano thought in whatever they were teaching. And if it was in literature, they wanted to read more about Chicano literature, you know, poetry, or writings, and stuff like that. And...and they wanted the teachers to address the stereotypes. Because in my class I...I, uh, came down on...you know, I...I...I criticized Octavio Paz for being a racist an—and saying that all Chicanos are this, you know, (Pachuko 41:49). And...and the way he talked about (Pachuko 41:52), he might as well be talking about poop on your shoe...shoes, and blaming women for the...being conquered, you know, that that was just a bunch of...um, let’s look at it. ",,,
,"So we would analyze him and say, “What’s...what do you see here?” We had already studied stereotypes, what’s the models of stereotypes, what are the trends and the patterns. And you apply that to Octavio Paz and, you know, perfect...perfect (? 42:21). And luckily, you know, we had Martha’s book, where she...she was also reinforcing thought on that. You know, I wasn’t alone and...I wasn’t a lone ranger. ",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"And, um...so there is, again, you know, kind of like erosion. But I’m still getting good evaluations. Well, one of the things that I worked with the students on is that the EOP students and...at Northridge, which was different than at Cal State Long Beach. A lot of them were married and already had children. Ah, but they didn’t...they didn’t live in San Fernando. And so when they moved to go to school they had their kids. They didn’t have childcare. And the childcare center there at Northridge had...ah, for the students, had long awaiting list, you know, long awaiting list. And, um, of course, you know, we have to do something, so, we were able to get another house, and, ah...convince the student body that we would have a third world women’s co-op. And that was a childcare center. And so the mothers would, um...ah, you know, man the...the childcare center, and they cooked the sandwiches, and, you know, they...they did all the administrating and...and caretaking of the children. Ah, and they worked together to create shifts, so...that would fit with their schedule, so they could go to school and they could go to their classes. They could have study time while somebody else was taking care of the children. And it was both the...the...the women and...and...and the...the...the mothers and the fathers. ",,
,"And, um...ah, what happened next was that I was teaching in a class. And I was the sponsor. I don’t know if I said that, but I’m the sponsor of this. So there’s a problem at the co-op. And whenever there’s a problem you get the sponsor and you go see what you can do about it. And so the students...two students, two mothers, came into my class and said, “You know, we’ve got a problem. And we really need your help.” I...and it...and it was a three-hour class, you know, I couldn’t leave it. And I said, “Well, we’re going to have to wait.” And she...and she says, “No, because your class ends after the kids leave and we really need you to tell us what to do now.” So, I go they wouldn’t be calling me if it wasn’t a...But they wouldn’t tell me what the problem was. But they wouldn’t be, you know, getting me out of class. These were mothers. These were parent—they were very responsible. And they had been taking care of the co-op. So if they need me, I’d better go. ",,,
,"So, I, um, didn’t counsel the class but I had the couns—the...the first hour counsel, told them to come back, go study, come back in an hour. I...so I go to, um, the co-op. And they show me these two kids. One is this tall and one is this tall. They’re two boys. The biggest boy has a big old blister. Ah, how do you say...um, a big old water blister from being burned on his forehead. You know how boys...their heads are bigger than their bodies and so it’s really this old blister. And, you know, that’s why they couldn’t tell me. I saw him. And then the other...the little one turns around and, ah, one of the mothers says, “Show them your hands.” And so he shows me the hands, big old water blister. I mean, their hand was swollen in one big old water blister. So...I say, “What happened?” And, ah, the kids proceed to say that, um, one of them had been bad, and the father was going to teach him a lesson. And, uh, I think it was the little one, or...I don’t know...I don’t remember which one. An—but what the father is going to do is he had this pot of boiling water, and he had one child and, you know, he was putting him in the pot, you know, to...for the steam to...threatening...threatening him in some manner. And the other one, ah, was trying to say, “You know, father, don’t, don’t, don’t,” was trying to help her...the...the other brother. And so he put the other brother down and got this boy, and got his hands into the pot, okay? So consequently, they had been scalded. And they had third degree burns, one here, one here. ",,,
,"So then I found out who the parents were. These weren’t just ordinary parents. They were officers of MEChA, okay? Ah, but it’s...it’s, ah, close to...it’s close to 4:00. And, you know, it was uns—you know, unspoken by all of us that we couldn’t send these kids back home, with their parents, that they weren’t safe. If they didn’t know that they had...that...know enough not to do this to their kids, much less to take them to the...back to co-op and let everybody know what they did, um, they had very bad judgment, and they weren’t safe. The kids wouldn’t be safe with them. So I said, “Call the welfare department. I don’t know what...” And this was before it was the law to notify the Department of Abuse Against Children. But it was just my gut feeling, you can’t send these home. An—but you can’t take them home with you. You know, it’s not legal. So I called the welfare dep—or the...I had the mothers call the Welfare Department. And they came, and they took custody of the kids. And I don’t know what happened to the parents, you know. Um, they...they took them. ",,,
,"Well, that was the end of the world for me because, then, uh, I got (in focus, so then, I don’t know, the next couple of days. Once Chicano Studies...the faculty, the leaders of the faculty, found out that I had called the welfare department to come and pick up these children, they...they were enraged. And they called the meeting with just me there. (? 49:43). Ah, and, ah, they wanted to know if it was true that I called the welfare department. And I said, “Yep.” And why did I do that? And I said, “Well, you know, the kids were in danger. They were...they had been mistreated. They had been abused. They...it wasn’t safe to send them home. So I called the welfare department. That’s the only agency I could think of who could help.” Oh, there I go, outside of Chicano Studies, and call an outside a—How dare I? I have betrayed Chicano Studies. This is all they needed, was to...something like this to try to destroy Chicano Studies. And what was I thinking?, and this and that. And I said, “Well, you know, they couldn’t go home and they weren’t safe.” I didn’t get it. So one of them tells me...you know, this a long meeting. I don’t know what all...I don’t remember. But what I do remember is, so one of them tells me, “You mean to tell me, if you had been at my house when I threw my teenage boy out the living room window, that you would have called the police?” No, no, “You would have called the welfare department?” I said, “No, I would call the police.” ",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"And that was the wrong thing to say, you know. I should have said I don’t know what. What would you do, or what—whatever. But I said, “Yes,” you know [chuckles], “You’re out of control. You’re abusing your kid. He’s in danger.” An—and so then he went in a rage and say how this wasn’t right, that I had to work within the framework of Chicano Studies, and...and that, uh, I couldn’t be trusted, and all these kinds of stuff. And I didn’t have the law to say, “Well, you know, the law requires you to do this.” I didn’t have that. Um...the department...I mean, childcare centers, I (? 51:53 know) they’re institutional now. In the colleges, they were not. They were a new thing. Even the one that was serving the common, ah...student body, it was still a new thing. Because they weren’t...they weren’t thinking about serving married or...or...or people who have children. Um, and so, they didn’t call the parents who were taking care of these children. They didn’t call the people who were working at the co-op. Of course it was my decision to say what to do about it but that was what a sponsor does. And so that was the...so then they had a forum and the student body of what I did, and this and that, and I...I...I...I can’t be trusted. And that’s when the tide began to turn. And then after that all kinds of accusations started to be, ah, hurled at me. And I really don’t want to go into what those accusations are because they are, uh...they’re not good. ",,
,"So, then we’re...it’s at that time...let’s see, that’s the fall, so in the spring they are doing evaluations for tenure. And, ah, Northridge had students and faculty on each committee doing the evaluation. And so, there was a (Mechista 53:53) female and a faculty person who was a female, um, on my evaluation committee, right? And they sat it in, in all my classes and, uh...uh, went through the procedures. And I was denied tenure. And I said, “You know, this is just about...uh, how can I have been getting excellent all along and then all of a sudden I’m denied tenure? This is about teaching Chicano classes. This is about sex discrimination.” Oh, I know what else I did. There was a lot of sexual harassment between some faculty and the students. And there was this one girl in particular who came to me for help because she had...I don’t know...I...I won’t say I know who attended it but people knew about this...sounded like a gang rape to me, okay? And, ah, is that what you call a gang rape, one women and the other, bunch...?",,,
,I,Yeah. ,,
,R,"Okay. And so, ah, I talked about it in the faculty. And I said, “You know, if you know this is going on, you need to tell those people to stop. This is wrong, you know, you’re exploiting students, especially students who have bad judgment.” And then out came, “Well, you know, she’s promiscuous. She...you know, she asked for it,” this and that, this and that. And I go, “Oh, wow.” I go, “You know, we’re faculty. We’re supposed to be here to serve the children...uh, the children, the...the students. And if, you know, something bad is happening, we’ve got to say, ‘That’s bad. Don’t do it.’” And, uh, she was, um...she had a lot of sexual identity problems, you know. Ah, and so she was, ah...really she was a...she reminded me of chil—children who are...or teenagers who run away from home, and they’re in the streets, and they’re just kind of like just looking for approval. And, ah, so she...she wasn’t the most clear-minded person, but she was the most vulnerable. She was not...you know, all the more reason to...to be, ah...all the more reason to, um, make clear what’s okay and what’s not. So that was a problem. ",,
,"So, ah...and then another problem was that, ah, the students started...in our classes, in our history of Chicano classes...oh, when we were talking about Third-World Women’s Studies, they were saying, let’s see, at that time Pinochet had been overthrown. Um, there were things happening South American and Iran and Africa...ooh, Zimbabwe. Oh, there were just...you know, Africa was exploding. And they wanted to know why, what was going on there?, and all this. And they...they wanted to, you know, meet other students who were from those countries who could tell them firsthand of what they knew and to give them some guidance. And then there were some teachers who were teaching about things. I said, “Well, you know, do you want to get together? Ah, let’s form a student group and ask these people to come and speak,” you know, just a forum, a treaty.",,,
,"Well, I didn’t talk to Chicano Studies about that. I thought it was, you know, to support students, to explore and find out what’s going on. Well, that was...I was told that was not what I was supposed to be doing because I was encouraging them to go outside of Chicano Studies. So I was challenging the FTE, threatening the FTE. And that I understood. I said, “You know, that’s not our intention. Because the students do want to know about these things. And if they do want to know, they’re going to go wherever the information is at.” But they said it was my fault. ",,,
,"So that’s some of the few things that went on. So then, um, when I found out that the women who had got tenure was the one who was evaluating me, then that’s a conflict of interest. So then I went to the Dean of Students. Now, I did not know about due process. I did not know about the teachers union, me, political on it. I didn’t know anything about that. But I went to the Dean of Students and I said, “You know, you can’t have...I think the evaluation should be done again by objective people. You can’t just have people with the same point of view, and the person who’s competing for tenure...” There was just one tenure slot. And the Dean says, “You know, I’m not going to challenge Chicano Studies. You know, that’s their...what they say, you know, that’s your problem. You’re going to have to decide how to fix it.” And I said, “Well, I will.” So, that summer I worked on developing my third world women’s history class curriculum. ",,,
,"I also worked on a slideshow that visually...because visually, it tells a whole lot more than the word. And so I got a...I wa—I...oh, I spent the whole summer, um, taking slides of different pictures that told the history of the Chicana. And, um, so I was ready for my classes. And I had this brochure. Because, you know, you always develop a brochure, so you can recruit and get more people to come in. Um, and nobody signed up for my classes. And they told me that, ah, students were being dissuaded to take my classes. So, when the semester started, I didn’t have any students in my classes. And, ah...I don’t know what all they told me. ",,,
,"Oh, I had tried to seek a lawyer. I...I couldn’t find any lawyer who were ready to tackle Chicano Studies. So, when I saw that nobody took my class and...we had...before that sem—semester, um, the semest—the spring semester we had a big old seminar. Ah, the students picketed, said this is sexism, that I should be given tenure. They made it into a forums. They had all kinds of speakers come and talk about, ah, sex discrimination in academia, and employment in general, and stuff like that, and, ah, got a lot of letters from people, ah, from all the universities. Barbara Carrasco made a, um...Barbara Carrasco and Robert Dura—Rodriguez...Robert was the editor of the newspaper, UCLA newspaper. And so Barbara drew a, uh...like a poster, but it was the cover of their newspaper. And Robert wrote this wonderful editorial thing on why...how this is an example of sexism in...at Northridge and that I should be given tenure. ",,,
,"So not too many people, ah, in academia came out to support me. And this was a student. These were students. It was a student organization. But other people from the community sent letters in support of me. But, um, you know, it didn’t change anybody’s mind. And, um, it kept on having, ah, meetings, ah, with the students. Like they organized the students against me. We’d have these meetings and they’d be, um, these filibuster meetings to, ah...to portray why I was the enemy. And, um, it was a very hostile time because, um...as an example of how hostile it had gotten was that, ah, Emilio, my son, who was like four, he had to go to the bathroom. Um, so the meeting is here, okay? ",,,
,I,Just hold a second. I’m sorry (? 1:02:38). ,,
,Part 4: ,,,
,R,"Okay, so I was talking about the hostility, the...the extent of the hostility. But in general, wherever there is racism or...or discrimination, forget racism, discrimination of any kind, violence is not far away, okay? That was always true when...when I was growing up San Bernardino. And in time I learned that was true of any kind...not just racism but also sex discrimination in the public life and in private life. And so, while they were having this confrontation with me in...in this classroom, which I...or in this meeting room, which I was trying to address really objectively and answer the questions, and you know, inform the students, and this and that...ah, my boy, who was four years old, I had to go to the bathroom. And at this point he wasn’t going in the women’s bathroom anymore. He is going to go in the boy’s bathroom. And, ah, I said okay. So I was outside of the bathroom but I...you go in right here, but I was more in the hallway, okay? And so somebody was talking to me and “Maybe you haven’t come out.” And I hear him calling me, you know, and hear some voices, male voices talking in there. So I go into the men’s bathroom and my four-year-old is against the wall with these two, ah...young adult men, intimidating my boy. And I go...so I go...And, ah, that was very frightening to me. That was very frightening. I go...that’s one thing, you know, it’s m—my job is a public life. But for whatever I’m doing, to threaten my boy, then, ah, it’s...it’s...it’s like Twilight Zone [imitates Twilight Zone theme song], what’s going on? And, ah, so I go through the men. I get my boy. And he is just like scared to pieces, you know. And, ah, so I get him and the guy’s close ranks. So there’s no spa—when I...they were like this. So I was able to go through there and get my boy. The guys closed their ranks, you know, and so they’re threatening me. And so I get Emilio and I push my way through. I don’t talk to them or anything, you know, because I don’t feel that words were going to work at that stuff. So I push my way through. And we go through. They didn’t say anything, or anything. It was mostly body language, okay? But they were definitely sending me a message, that...to get out. And, ah...at that point, there was...other students who were supporting me had gotten the...the, ah...the leaders had gotten in a screaming match to them and they had gotten threatened. Um, they were threatening them. And, ah, at that point I said, you know, “We’ve got to go. We’ve got to go.” We go home. And, ah, I said, “If it’s at the point that you’re not talking about a job anymore, you’re talking about violence towards people who don’t agree with you, then this is a very dangerous situation. I really don’t know what to do with it, you know, especially if...as there was more and more intimidation.” You know, support started...like people just didn’t feel safe coming and speaking up for you. ",,
,"And, uh...and that’s where I began to, you know, visually...people supported me in spirit but they knew it wasn’t safe. And I don’t know what all they went through. I only know what I saw. And, ah, so at that point I said, “You know, I’m in a fight that I don’t...I...I don’t know about. I...this is a whole different world. This is something that, ah, I didn’t ask for, that I...I didn’t know I w—” It was like, you know, you decide to go base—to play baseball but you end up finding out you’re wrestling [laughs]. And [laughs] how do you get into this? So, it’s at that point that, uh, I was really, really, really intimidated. And then I started getting phone calls, intimidating phone calls. And I...I was...I was harassed in all sorts of ways. And they not only would threaten me, they would threaten my boy. So I took my boy out of childcare, you know. ",,,
,"And, ah...ah, it was near the end of the semester, so I went home for the summer, for summer, do you know, and I thought it would get better. Meanwhile, you know, I was preparing for the next semester, the curriculum. And...because being...I felt I was born to be a Chicana Studies teacher. That’s what I thought I was. This...you know, I never knew what I was going to be when I grew up, you know. I never knew. Ah, but the...being an editor, ah, encouraged people to write, helped them write, uh, getting...getting it into a complete piece, making it a final product, oh, I loved that. Getting Chicana Studies curriculum going, getting, you know, more...more classes going throughout the nation, getting Chicano Studies to, ah, require Chicana classes as part of the major, you know. That...that is one thing I had accomplished there, is that I had...they had agreed to get...at least one Chicana class would be a requirement, not an election but a requirement. ",,,
,"Um, but there was...I knew it wasn’t the same everywhere, so that was like what I was going to do because I...ah, doing the research, like I had all my different places in the...in the library, the labor...labor history, history...there was the, uh...um, pre-Columbian research on the other floor. Ah, and that was a trip, you know, reading, ah, all these, uh, old documents in Spanish. You know, oh, they write for days, all this flowery stuff for days, for days, for days, you know [chuckles]. But I realized I knew more Spanish than I understood. You know, I mean, I...I...I never had confidence in my Spanish, but the fact that I was understanding all of this, I go, you know, am I going to start talking pretty soon? ",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"So, um, it was...I...I just saw all these classes coming together. You know, I thought that we really had to explore...because, at the time, the movement was the Mestizo, right, the Indian, the Spaniard, and the, ah...the Mestizo here. And I go, ah, it’s not really like that, okay? It’s that...one that might reflect more our self-doubt. Because we are one; we are not divided. A self cannot be divided. A self must be one. If it’s divided it’s in conflict. Okay, are we or aren’t we? And, so we...we really need to go t—into the issue of mis—not just genocide but miscegenation, you know. And we need to go before the Europeans came over and look at, um...first, it was about the (malinche myth 8:30), right? But...so we really have to look at, ah...um, what was going on in Mexico before the Europeans came, and that Mexico was not one. It was multiple nations, and that the Aztecs were as bad as any, ah, tyr—tyrant or tyrannical culture going on in the world. So, ah...and that people were revolting against them. That’s why these few Spanish were able to undermine them then, and they had alliances and they had support. ",,
,"But let’s go more into it. Who? Why? What was going on? Who were these different people? Were they, ah, united together or separately and what happened afterwards, you know? Um, s—and then, Ah...and then the deities and the goddesses, how...where are they indigenous? Because they have multiple names in different places, and they have different intonations. And what...what is the story? What’s behind this story? Who are...you know, and at that time they didn’t know as much as they know now. I mean, you can really do that now. Thirty years, forty years later, it’s...it’s really ripe to develop those kind of classes on...on, you know, history of the Chicano or...or just history of colonization and...and genocide. ",,,
,"And you can look at any war, and look at that. You know, that’s...that’s one of the things that, ah...that, you know, there’s a international conference every year in San Diego. And it’s on domestic violence. And they always have a segment there on, uh, miscegna—genocide and war, you know. And, ah...ah, we...we...that’s a really a key to our history, and maybe even our identity, you know, as Indians, as Mestizo, you know, or...or as Mexicans. Not as Indians, not as, ah, Mestizos or half-Spanish, but as Mexicans. That is our c—Mexican cultural heritage, just like, ah...the slaves, part of their identity comes back from being slaves. ",,,
,"Well, we also have similar-like roots that are reflected in the culture over and over again, you know. We may not even realize it. You know, we may even say it in joking, or (concareno 11:16), or a loving way. Um, but, ah, it...as you’re more assimilated, it means less. But as you’re more, ah...educated in the culture, and it’s part of you, it...and it may mean more than we’re really conscious of. And, ah, to me that’s me that’s interesting. To me, especially coming from...I know I come from that history. I know that, ah, I’m the product or rape. Not me personally, but my family is a product of rape, my...a product of...of not having any rights against...you know, not having rights to...to...to say, “This crime was committed against us,” and the policemen saying, “Sorry, you don’t have any rights here,” you know. Um, the woman story, the migration of women, you know, from Mexico to the United States, being in the United States, especially during the early 1900’s, if you were alone and a si—a single parent, those were...those were hell of a women who really had to...were very vulnerable in that society, very vulnerable. ",,,
,"Because if you were trying to run away from man, and you were married to him, even though you were in Bisby, Arizona, and the guy’s in Mexico, there’s all this letter writing, and if somebody’s looking for you, you are somebody’s husband and so they should know. So you could never run away. You know, how...now we have all kinds of communication. But back then you didn’t really. You just had letters. And still, someone could hunt you down, uh, because you were somebody’s property. ",,,
,"So, all these things interest me. And I think that, ah, they would interest other peoples. And they could be analyzed, in terms of, ah, a, um, political, economic, social, psychological, cultural way. Just there’s so many dynamics. And I’m sure there’ll be a diversity of thought along the way, but they should be explored. And in time we...we would come to say, “You know, we are we. We’re not three, we’re not part this, part that, part this, part that. You know, uh, you’re not real...we won’t be s—oh, you’re not a true Mexican. You know, what kind of Mexican is that?” (? 13:51) to that kind of talk. It’s not funny. It’s not good. It’s not good for us. It’s not good for our kids. Um, and it’s not good for anybody, who—whoever they are. You know, uh, historically, people...children have been rejected because, whatever their mother or father did, whatever race or family they came from, whether they came from this side of the tracks or it’s that side of the tracks, that kind of class mentality is reflected in the culture and it’s never good. But it’s always to somebody’s advantage. ",,,
,"But we use it and it’s not even to our advantage. But we still use it. So it’s like a remnant. I wrote...I wrote a article long time ago that we have these remnants of these col—feudal colonial history that is very reflected in our sexual roles, you know, ah, that really are remnants of, ah...ah, feudalism, you know, being somebody’s property, whether you’re a man or a women, you know, being somebody else’s property. And, uh, there’s nothing so precious about that. ",,,
,I,"So [chuckles], I do have to ask you one last thing. And it follows on what you’ve said just now. The last question in our list of questions was, you know, where you think like Chicana feminism is today. When you were extremely active in the movement, before you were sort of pushed out of the academic side of the movement, you know, it’s very clear that Chicana feminism was happening in (15:53 En Quentro Feminine), and newspapers, at conferences. It was being articulated in those spaces and even in the classes that you taught, the early...the groundbreaking classes that you were teaching. What do you think...where do you see it today? Where is it today? Is it in the streets? Is it in conferences? Is it in the academy? ",,
,R,"Um...I see it more alive outside of the campus than on the campus. But it definitely is on the campus. The reason why I see it more outside of the campuses, that the students, women, young women, are...I don’t know what’s happening in the community. But, you know, like for instance, I meet more high school graduates that already pretty independent, self-sufficient. They’ve gon—they’re...they’ve done a lot of things on their own. They’re so defined. Ah...they had a...um, a high school recruitment there at Cal State Long Beach, and I had bumped into some of the girls. And, uh, this one was, uh, just graduating from high school this year but she was already...she saw in her mind she had some kind of business plan, ah, for, um, advertising. She was mixing graphic arts, and, um, communications, and (kinsinethas 17:36) together. And she already had developed a...a business. ",,
,"Um, a lot...uh, some other women...just they’re more...they’re more centered. They’re more independent. Centered meaning independent, you know. So they have had more experience in, um...uh, self, uh, development and doing a lot of things before they even graduate from high school than normal. So they have a sense of self. They have a sense of, uh, what do I want, uh, about the way they wanted to be treated. If there is, ah...bad news somewhere, they don’t want to be there, they’re not going to take it, they just move on. They’ve got...they’ve got things to do, uh...uh, stories to write, and...and...and they’re going forward. And I don’t remember that being that prevalent. But I find that that’s more prevalent. And even those women that I bump into who...you know, at these different conferences, who are the young...the recruits, they may not know what they want to be but they know that they’ve got place—y—things to learn and stories to...And they even know",,,
,"...like for instance, I met this one woman. She was a history major at UCR. But for whatever reason she decided to be a doctor. She had no background. So she said, “I have to start all over again, take all the sciences.” And I’d say, “How’re you doing in that?” And he says, “Well, it’s been really hard because I don’t understand why, you know, these systems work like this.” So she had no foundation in biology, no fou—foundations in systems theories, or statistics, chemistry. She didn’t know how they were all related. But no problema, she was going to find out. And she was beginning to synthesize it. And I just came along and met her just at the right time, when she was synthesizing it. And she was telling me about it. I was a stranger out of nowhere. You know, I didn’t find that. I...I don’t remember finding that at that time, okay? ",,,
,"So, to me, that’s part of feminism, is, uh...uh, being independent, defining yourself, being comfortable in, um, exploring, ah, something you don’t know, and be comfortable with things you don’t know but the co—uh, confident you’re going to master it, you’re going to find out, and confident that you’re going to find out if you like this or not, and if you don’t, that’s okay because you see yourself accomplishing something, and writing about it, talking about it. Ah, it’s a very exciting...this is just a...I see it more in the women talking, and...and being more self-defined, and independent. That’s the key thing. You know, they’re driving. There’s these little cues. ",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"You know, just because you see more Chicanos driving is a very, very critical indicator of, uh, their extent of experience in independent decision-making, confidence in their decisions, successful decisions, and having a sense of, “I’m here, I’m going to go there,” you know, “And this is what I think,” and then...and good listeners, but don’t feel the pressure that they have to think the same way somebody else had just finished talking about, you know, “We might want to think about that. We’ll see.” You know. I like that. ",,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"I like that. So I see that change. Ah...and it’s very healthy. Very healthy. So I don’t know that it’s about more assimilation. I don’t know what that’s about. Maybe there’s more support. There’s more resources out there. Whatever it is, it’s a good thing. On academics, I see things pretty much...there are more women in academia. There are more women promoting gender and sexual issues. I...from what I hear, they have the sa—they’re going through many times the same struggles that I went through. I think the big issue right now in academia is, ah, homosexuality and I think that that’s real intense and very hostile, you know. And so that that hostility needs to be, um, resolved before it goes too far, and, um, mellowed out, and...and mediated, and address the hostility, not just the issue, but the hostility really needs to be a—addressed and seen. It’s like ignoring that there’s a hungry tiger in the room. I mean, you’ve got to millio—there’s a hungry tiger in the room and we’ve go to get it out. How do we do this? So I’m really worried about that. ",,
,"And, ah, the...I...I’d say lesbian thought, I haven’t seen too much male gay...um, heard or seen male gay thought. You know, so, um, I can only comment on the lesbian Chicana thought. That is very, um, mind-blowing. I mean, it’s using symbols in a way that I’ve never seen. It’s communicating ideas that I don’t always get. Um, and it’s very thought-provoking. And, ah, I...I really...I’ve only heard a couple, so I really would like to hear a lot more. Because then these symbols, these traditional symbols...like there was a...I just recently saw a presentation on...this woman presented our lady of Guadalupe in different...different poses. And she shares that she’s, ah...gay and the struggle she’s had in coming out, and how all of that is reflected in the (? 24:14) de Guadalupe. Now I, myself, think it’s a long time that we kind of like, ah...well, people are not going to like this but I think it’s long time that we put our lady Guadalupe on the shelf...",,,
,I,[Chuckles]. ,,
,R,"...and move forward, that the...the...the person that we should be putting forth is your mother, your father, ah, just a woman in general, you know, your sister...us, the contemporary person, ah...and say we are. Okay, we are. And...and we’re proud of it, whatever. Okay. Our lady...but I understand why Our Lady of Guadalupe is so important. As a matter of fact, when she made that presentation, I finally understood why it was so important. Because I always would tell Richard, I’d go, “You know, there was some girl who, ah, was denied tenure because she was a artist and she did, ah, big portrait of our lady of Guadalupe.” And I don’t think there was anything revolutionary about it. It was just a painting. And they felt it wasn’t academic enough. I think that was the...their...their criticism. And I talked to, ah, (Mailie 25:36) and Richard. I go, “Why do we have to still do our lady of Guadalupe? How isn’t there something more substantial that represents today?” And he goes, “Anna, she’s very important. You have to understand, it’s faith and religion.” And I go, “Well, that’s true, I don’t understand.” But when I saw this lady’s – and I’m sorry that I don’t remember her name – but when she presented our lady of Guadalupe, then it was like the nose on my face, and I was very embarrassed. Because it’s about acceptance, about love. It’s about, ah, belonging, you know. It’s about...it really is another way of we are. And, ah, I wish that...I...like I like the (? 26:29 En Quentro) symbol, with a crowd of women, and men, and children. That’s we are, you know, (somos, casomas, somas de a quy 26:34). You know, and that’s it, no ifs or butts. You know, we don’t have to explain. Um, and we’re real. ",,
,"But, you know, love, acceptance from a...for our people, or a person who feels rejected, denied, a nonentity, ah, an outcast...I finally got it, you know. And, and, uh...unfortunately, she got a lot of criticism, and so did the students who invited her over because it was...what do you call it, uh...what do you call it when you do something bad that’s really just...sacrilegious? There’s another word for it though. ",,,
,I,Blasphemy? ,,
,R,Blasphemy. ,,
,I,Blasphemous. ,,
,R,"Uh, maybe it was blasphemy. But it was all those kinds of words, you know, that...that this woman had committed. And, ah...and they lost the point. You know, this is about acceptance, love. Both sexual love and...and...and, ah, a general love. So there’s that...that’s...that’s...and...and I haven’t really, ah...I don’t...I haven’t really exposed to it all, but I’ve read quite a lot. I don’t always get it because I think it’s, um...it’s...it’s still in the hostile stage, you know. And, uh...uh, so, where it’s hostile there’s always a little self-hate, always, you know, because you’re just projecting out. So, I guess that’s the healing part. It depends on what they’re actually saying. Because I know...used to read Chicano Press and then read all this hostility. And again, that’s again, you know, saying, “Stop it. You know, I hate you for being so...so hostile and cruel.” But also, that’s still inside. Uh, it’s so damaging. Racism, sexism is very damaging. Very damaging. And then, ah, if you’re rejected for whom you are than you...it stunts your development. That’s the end. Does that answer your question? ",,
,I,[Chuckles]. We’re done. ,,
,The End,,,
