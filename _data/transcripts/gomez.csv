And I was pretty, um...I didn’t know it at the time, but I was pretty wounded, you know. I didn’t know what was going on, I didn’t know why the things happened that happened. And like they had even threatened, the guys and the teachers have even threatened my son. I mean...I...I was, ah, in...I was in shock. Kind of like in bomb shock. How do they call it?",socialist
,I,Hm. Shell shocked.,
,R,Shell shocked.,
,I,Um-hum.,
,R,"So they asked me to go speak. I said, “Okay, I’ll go speak.” And then I’m speaking, you know. And I don’t know what happened, but there was a big fight. And I don’t know if some guy...I think...I remember some guy saying something, and then another guy saying something. And then there was this (larujo 1:44) back and forth. And so then they were trying to get out of there. And there was like, you know, these guys, ah...ah, knights in shining arm—trying to protect me and...and...and these other guys. Then I go, I don’t even know what...“Why are you fighting?” you know. And then this smart guy says, “We better get you out of here and get you home.” I go, “That’s a good idea. Because I don’t know, I’ve already been in a buzz, and I have no idea what this buzz is all...I totally missed it, you know. If I could ever meet somebody who was out there, I’d like to ask them, “What...what went on?” So then [laughs] they take me home, they put me on a airport, in the airline, and I’m going home, and I go...I...I think I’m not going to speak anymore, because I...I don’t know what’s going on here, you know. My mom’s right. I should get out of here. I should get out of here for the...Oh, and then...So then when I went home, with my mom, she took me home. And my mom did not approve of was I...my involvement. But, you know, when...when shit it’s the fan, my mom was the only one there to, ah, take me home. ",
,"And, ah, so this lady from the Socialist Party...was it Socialist Party...Because at that point, everybody approached me. And I didn’t know who these people were. Socialist Par—? I knew socialist, but ATM, there was another one...ah, I don’t remember.",,

,I,I do too.,
,R,"Anyway, um, so she kept on calling me and saying, “You need to join the party, we really need you. You know, we’ll support you,” this and that. So I said, “No, you know, I’m not doing anything. I don’t even know what you’re all about. I’ve only read, you know, some things that people have written. But I don’t know what you’re all about. So I ain’t doing it.” And so she kept on...she come in the middle of the night. She started harassing me, and she said, “Don’t you...aren’t...you’re so ungrateful,” you know, “We support you,” this and that. “You know, lady, you call me again, I call the police.” [laughter]. But it really brought out a lot of crazy people out of the woodwork, you know? And...and after my experience there at that conference, I go, “I don’t know what they’re fighting now, but everybody’s fighting about ideology.” Had already been through that ideology thing there, ah, with CASA, and, ah...everybody. And, ah, I said [laughs], “Been there, done that, ain’t going there.”",ideology

,I,"Well, thank you, Anna, for agreeing to talk with us. And I know I’ve explained a little bit about what we want to do, and then that’s really kind of, um, get an understanding or provide a greater in-depth understanding about the development of Chicana feminism. Um, and so I think a good way to start this is to...to just ask you about, um, what your life was like growing up, and...and what led you, what you think led you to, um, your, you know, (conscienticacion 5:05). Like how...how did you come to that place? And then after we’ll talk a little bit about the first encounters with the Chicana Movement. But now I’d like to know a little bit about your background and your family and growing up.",
,R,"Um-hum. Well, I think it was, um, ah, my environment. I was raised in San Bernardino, in California. It was a segregated community. Um, ah, which in LA...LA is segregated also, but the whole world is Chicano, or the whole world is Black, and so you’re not so aware of the...of the boundaries. And there’s so many people, I don’t think you’re...the police are all that involved unless you’re in Beverly Hills, that you don’t belong there. But in a small rural...I don’t know about rural town. Um, they range...raised, um, oranges, Santa Fe Railroad, and Kaiser were the main...main, um, employment. ",childhood
,,"So, ah, you know about racism, okay? You experience it in your daily life. Like, for instance, there was an informal curfew. If...so you know where the borders are and what happens if you don’t deal that...um, don’t observe that border. You experience it in the schools, you know. You...you raise your hand and the teacher will not call you, or when they call you, they’re full of disgust. Or they’ll shame the students. If you know an answer and nobody else knows the answer, then how can this dirty Mexican know?, you know. And they would say those things open with total confidence. Ah, so that part was very clear. And, um, quite frankly, I thought it was normal. And so I grew up thinking it doesn’t really matter what they think, because what they think is totally off the wall. What happ—what’s important is my mom, my dad, the family. And the West Side. Because the West Side was, ah, where the Chicanos live. ",racism; childhood; education
,,"So when I went to, um, Cal State Long Beach, um, I just, um, met students that [clears throat], you know, were experiencing racism, the first alienation on the campus. I was too. And, ah, also racism in the...in the classrooms. Same thing – they wouldn’t answer your questions. You wait in line after the classroom to ask questions and the teachers were just...turn around and walk...walk away. They weren’t even going to hear what your questions were. So it was tough. So, um, ah, so when we began to organize, the way we were treated by the Chicano students, male...the males, was totally different than I had ever experienced, you know. And they, ah, they said I was like a chingada, they said, they thought I was totally dumb, because I didn’t know who Cesar Chavez is. I say, “Well, you know, I don’t know who Cesar Chavez is. But I know what this racism...racism is all about. You don’t have to tell me about that.” And, um, most of these Chicanos were from LA. So they hadn’t experienced. To them, their awareness was raised differently in terms of the...they had been raised with Chicanos and it...the school, the quality of the education, the whole horrible environment there, but it was different than from where I came. But they treated women like, um, their servants.",chicanos; racism; education
,,"I had never had that experience. My pop did not treat my mom like a servant. They were partners. Um, ah...they were partners, and they told me and they would tell everybody, that the only way they were going to achieve their dreams and a better life for their kids was for mom and dad to work together. So they worked together to achieve their dreams, be that...their dream was the house, to build a house, their dream house. Or to provide for us. ",childhood;feminism
,,"[clears throat] And so my mom had always worked. My dad had always worked, but he couldn’t because he had a AA degree. He got two. First he wanted to be a mor...um, a mortician, because he was in Moore’s Marauders, he was a medic. And, ah, so he had the GI Bill to get a education. So while he was a medic, the doctors there were really impressed with him. And they said when the War is over, we’ll finance, we’ll get you money so you can go to John Hopkins. And, ah, but when my dad came out, he had shrapnel in his...he had experienced a brain...brain injury, and malaria. So it took him like...he was in quarantine for a very long time, before he actually was discharged. And he was still not well. So he pretty much thought he wasn’t in shape to be a doctor. But he loved the human body, and the...He was very curious guy. Very curious. And so he got his AA in that. And, but we were sick. He got it here in LA. But we were sick with asthma, because LA was like smogged to pieces, you know, black. And they thought we were going to die, because we couldn’t breathe. So, um, we had to move back to San Bernardino where the air used to be clean. And so he couldn’t find a job. You know, the main...the main morticians there were on the East Side and they weren’t going to hire a Mexican, because nobody wanted a Mexican to handle their dead. ",
,,"So he did find a job working with Tilly, who was a black businessman there. But he didn’t have enough business to support my dad full-time. So my dad went back to school. He got another AA degree in electronics, and then he got a job for the Feds in quality control. So all this time, he had been having problems because of discrimination. Even before he went to LA CC for his mortician degree, um, right away when he and my mom were going to get married, or planning to get married, he went to go get a job for the Santa Fe, because my mom had worked there since she graduated from high school. And, ah, my dad was there five o’clock in the morning. It was like, he said, he was number five there, because jobs were scarce there after the war. And the supervisor wouldn’t interview him. So fin—it’s quarter to five, and then he says, “I’m going to interview you. Don’t...you know, okay, let’s interview.” And my dad said, “Um-um.” And he said, “What do you mean? You have opportunity for a job.” He says, “I’m not working for you or people like you. I already had enough of that,” you know. “I’m...I’m a veteran and I need to be treated better.” So unfortunately being treated better meant working...like he ended up being a warehouseman at Edwards Air Force. It was, you know, jobs that...that, ah, he...he could have been doing better jobs than that. So while he was trying to work, find better jobs, my mom had to go back to work for the Santa Fe. ",
,,"So I always knew them both as working. They always helped each other. They discussed things. My mom’s strengths and my dad’s strengths, they balanced each other. So my dad never felt alone, my mom never felt alone. They just, you know...I’m sure they had, you know, husband and wife problems as terms of always having different ideas. But they seemed to work it out. And then my grandpa also had – my mom’s dad – had that same kind of relationship with my grandma. And she...and he made sure that everybody got a grad—high school education. And so there was that positive, nurturing role models for men. And also, most of my dad’s peer group that we hung out with, they were all men from veterans. And they treated their women, you know, differently, but still they had the same idea, we had to work together. I think...I’m not...I really wasn’t aware who didn’t work and who did. But they all had active roles, it appeared to me. So...",feminism
,[break],,
,R,"...roles it appeared to me. So...so that was the environment I came from. So you go into MEChA, and you talk and nobody listens, you know. That...it was bizarre. Or you talk and maybe they’ll stop talking. But you say your ideas, and it’s not acknowledged, and they keep on talking, talking. And somebody else says exactly what you said. And Corinne and I...and it was a small group of people. In the beginning, it was a small group of people, forming UMAS. And so we were pretty much we thought on a equal basis. You think maybe ten at the most. Um, but it...you began to see that, um, class consciousness between men and women there. And so it wasn’t until I told (? 15:40) that we started cussing. And you cussed first. If you cussed afterwards, nobody’s going to listen, but if you cuss first, with gusto, you know, and maybe just as good or better than they did, they stopped and they listen. And so that’s...that’s when we started to be heard. And we were only two women. The rest...no, there was me, Corinne, Mary Lou, and another girl. But Mary Lou was very traditional. So she knew how to work that men-women thing, which I didn’t understand. But I noticed that they listened to her more, because she talked to the men and then through the men and they would talk. So I didn’t...I didn’t understand that. Now I do, but I didn’t at that time. But Corinne and I, we didn’t come from that world. So, ah, when we experienced that, then we figured out the game, and so we started acting more masculine, you know. Or big cuss word. Or, um...slam on the table, you know, or...You know, just everything that my mother would ki—do something...",chicanos; machismo
,I,[laughs],
,R,"...about. Okay? Ah, so, um...but in the beginning, I felt the way they were...was not very...was rude, disrespectful, that their mothers would be ashamed of them. And I would often threaten, “You know, I’m going to tell your mom. I’m going to talk to my mom, and she’s going to talk to your mom, and this is going to stop now.” But, you know, of course, I never met their mom, and my mom lived in San Bernardino, their mom lived in LA, and they weren’t ever going to talk to each other. And my family didn’t know their family, so there was not...not that accountability, so to speak. So we started acting like what they called (machas 17:45), you know. Um, but it was not acceptable at home. And so that was really hard to be a macha in this world and then in the real world be, you know, to behave in a educated way. You know, to behave with manners and courtesy and stuff, and no cussing.",
,,"                And I got to admit, you know, it was quite liberating to cuss. Because we were never supposed to cuss. And to get that kind of response...And because it was such a hostile environment, and like so and so’s, we didn’t realize it was a hostile environment. You know, we just figured these guys were difficult, but we had a goal to do. Um, we experienced an empowerment of being listened to. And we didn’t stop to think that if we have to go this far to be listened to, this is not really where we should be. We should...this is not a healthy environment, and either from our own organization or be somewhere where it’s healthier. We can promote ourselves as well as make things happen. ",
,,"                But because we felt that we could manage it, we could handle it, you know, yeah, we just stuck with it. I think that’s pretty much it. Ah, but we questioned it. You know, like we were organizing a Chicana Studies conference, and like twelve o’clock. And only Corinne and I were there in the middle of the night. And we didn’t have, you know, copiers that collated. So you had like all these position papers. So it was a whole room, maybe three times the size of this, all these tables. We had all these position pa—And there Corinne and I were collating the...the position papers, you know. And so we would talk. And I said, “You know, Corinne, do you know...” Oh, because first we learned to cuss in Sp—ah, English, you know. I don’t want to say the words. Then we learned to cuss in Spanish. And then to cuss in Spanish, I said, “Do you know really what that means?” I said, you know, we’re really talking against ourselves. You know, we’re really attacking ourselves by saying that, especially in, um, Spanish. And then, especially the history.” Because I had read, ah, Octavio Paz, which I consider a very racist stereotyp (sic.) book, and I thought we shouldn’t use it. But I didn’t know what...what the roots were of, you know, chingada. And so I said, “Do you realize what we’re doing?” You know, “We’re just advocating attack on women, violence against women.” And Corinne says, “Look, it works, works for us. If it works, don’t fix it.” You know. ",
,,"                So there wasn’t enough of us to really work that out and say, “No, nobody should be saying that, because it’s...it’s anti-woman. It’s promoting violence, you know. But we were having enough trouble as it was. So then, um, ah...so I...to answer the question is that because the MEChA, UMAS’s MEChA environment was so contrary to the way I had been raised, to the way that Corinne had been raised, that it was that experience that raised the woman’s question. Because we kept on having to...",
,,"                Oh, and then...okay. So we experienced that in the growth from UMAS to MEChA. So when we started recruiting, ah, the students into MEChA and they would come in and they would want to know, and they would...They’re looking for a supportive environment, right? But, um, ah, somehow, part of the right of passage, it seemed for some men – some, not all – was for them to, you know, be macho, and part of being macho was, you know, sexually harass the women, to treat women like servants, to bully them, to become condescending to them. Or, you know, to make them feel important, you know, like be good to me, I’ll be good to you. ",
,,"Um, and so...so we...when we started talking about raising awareness of the men and women, the women said, “We need to know more,” and they would raise questions and this and that. And so the dudes say, you know, ah...it was their idea really to form a woman’s organization, a woman’s committee. It was real—I never...but it was their idea, ah, to form a woman’s committee. And Corinne and I were supposed to meet with them and raise their awareness about, you know, racism, MEChA, what are the goals, this and that, you know, so that they didn’t have to waste their time with it, right? So we would. ",
,,"And so what happens when you, ah, do some training and development with people? They start asking their own questions, and they start being more assertive, and, ah, questioning and evaluating reflecting back. And then guys weren’t all that very comfortable with that. So, but they wouldn’t ask the particular individuals about it. When we would have our leadership meetings, they would ask me and Corinne, “What did Norma mean when she said this?” “What did Helen mean when she said this?” I said, “How do I know?” You know, but it’s like all women think the same. Or it had something to do with what...our meeting with them. So I said, “You got to ask those people.” [laughs] I mean...",feminism; chicanos; machismo
,,"But then, you know, like when you read about history and you read about racism, you see the same parallel. You know, the class whose got the...the leadership or the foreman or supervisor, it’s only going to talk to one person, and they have to explain for everybody else. And I go...this...we’re going backwards here. We’re going forwards. We were making such great strides in terms of organizing the student organization, recruiting students, developing a counseling program, retention program. Teachers’ program. I mean, we were just doing such positive things. But internally, it was becoming a hostile...it was a hostile environment. And I think that was often why...Because a lot of the young Chicano males who would come in there and see that, I think it was distasteful to them as well as to a lot of the women, and they wouldn’t come back. And then the MEChAs would say, “Where is everybody? We work so hard for them but they’re not here, you know? Ah, and only those who had maybe experience with that and thought they could hand that stayed. I don’t know why people stayed and why they didn’t. I don’t know why I stayed and I didn’t. So I...but, you know, someone else can figure that out.",racism
,,"Um, so that’s how the women’s question raised. So when that started happening, and then as a counselor with EOP and working in this training and development community with the women, they were coming up these problems as far as retention issues. That’s what we called retention issues. And they were different than what we were hearing from the men. And a lot of the young men, what their issues were, were a lot about identity. And some of them, this male identity...because they were now men. And what does that mean? And to be a man means, you know, I should be outside working, but here I’m still dependent, I’m a student. You know, I don’t think my father really respects me here. ",
,,"Ah, so there’s a lot of things about identity for the men that they were working out one way or the other. And they...and they would share that with me because I was their counselor. But I don’t know what went in in MEChA. They discussed that. ",
,,"But with the women, it had everything to do with homesickness, pressure from family and friends and boyfriend to go home, you know, what are they doing?, to, choices, being independent, um...feeling different. Not just among a white Anglo organi—institution. Because they lived in the dorms. But also they were different, you know, because they...there was all...such a heavy stereotype on what a Chicana should be. And like you’d talk to all these different they...you know, “I’m not like that.” It’s like there was a stereotype. So there was pressure to be something they weren’t. And they were wondering, “What’s wrong with me?” [laughs]",chicanas; education
,,"So...so we started to address that, you know, and support them, and just have them explore. And then there was the whole thing about, even though, um, birth control had been around for a couple of years, it wasn’t really something that I knew about. And it was just becoming accessible there at the student health center. But it wasn’t to everybody. I don’t know why. But it wasn’t to everybody. And so, um...oh, I think it was at that point they were just giving it to students who were having...in college. And so those women who knew that was the line, then they would, you know, put that. But, ah...that was just a small group of people who knew how to play the system. ",
,,"Ah, so there was again, the sex thing, you know, sexual...ah, should I have sex with my boyfriend over there in Fresno or Visalia, or wherever I am. And then the sexual harassment that would come in, you know, with these cool, um...Don Juans, you know. And it was really men just trying to practice on their...their spiel, you know, their pick-up (run 29:28). I mean, these were just young men trying to learn how to do it right. Um, so, ah, and then the girls would fall in love and...All that kind of growing up problems. ",
,,"And so, ah, I became very aware of how serious it was when we were doing statistics and...In EOP we saw where the women had higher grades than the guys did. And I go, wow! That’s amazing. And I wondered why. And then...but the women had higher drop-out rate. And I said, whoa! That’s a loss, you know, why? Um, and so I said...as a matter of fact, these women were doing a whole lot better than I. You know, they had a lot better skills than I had. And...because if you have so many B’s and so many A’s and just a few C’s, that was not my story.",
,,"So I go. There’s...why are they going? So the...just a group like Corrina, just...Martha...just a group that ended up being (ijas 30:45). We started, you know, having women, ah, just a random sampling of women. And really it was about, um, pressure from home to get married, ah...getting pregnant, or having sex – not getting pregnant, but being dumped, and wondering what that was all about. And now they were fallen women, you know. They had...they had been betrayed and they had betrayed their family, they had betrayed this and that. And then those women who...who already had...had sexual experience, um, I don’t...I don’t know why they left. But there was something...something there too, however they interpret it. ",
,,"So it took...it took something special for those women to stay on. And those women who did stay on usually were able to develop their own peer group along their...their interests. Like if they were artists, you know, they...they got recognized within their own group of interests. Um, so...but it wasn’t coming from MEChA. You know, MEChA was not helping the women stay on...on campus. So, um, one time – I’ve told this story a hundred times...but, not one time, but a couple of times...",Feminism; MEChA
,,"Well, the one time I remember is that this little Chicanita, she...tiny, she was tiny. I don’t even think she weighed a hundred pounds. She was less than five feet. Um, and she called me at home. I was her counselor, EOP counselor. And she said she was at Emergency Hospital. And I go, “What are you doing there?” And she goes, “I tried to abort myself with a coke bottle and I...I’m hemorrhaging. I don’t know if I’m going to live.” I go...I don’t think I knew what an abortion was at that point. All this...you know, all these experience that I had, then I would go read about it, you know. So some help I was, right? So I go see her, and my remembrance is that her tiny hand is in mine, my big hand. And I’m the only one she has. Because she couldn’t tell her family. The dude was...had split. She couldn’t tell her friend. This was her secret, you know. And we all hopefully by now know about that secret. And, um, I go, “Do you want me to call your mom?” you know. She says, “No, no. They’ll disown me.” I said, “What about your boyfriend?” She says, “He’s already disowned me. He has nothing to do with it. He says it’s not even his.” And...and then she would plead with me, and she pleaded with me, “Ah, but it is his. This is my...I never had sex with anyone. You have to believe me.” I said, “It’s okay, it’s okay. I believe you. I believe it.” But she’s already like blaming herself for this and feeling it’s the end of the world, and really wanting to die. Wanting to die. Because she had, ah...she had broken the coke bottle in her uterus, and it had ripped it to shreds, so she couldn’t have any more children. And so she was like, “Why did they save me?” You know. “What am I going to do?” And, ah, all I could do was say, “It’s going to be okay.” I...I go, “You know, peop—women get pregnant, what...what...this wasn’t something you have to die for,” you know. “It wasn’t worth your life. You know, your life is worth more than, ah...more valuable than just what people think.” ",
,,"So, um...then I had a couple other experiences similar. Some of them think they’re pregnant. But it was all around pregnancy and abortions. And then we started talking about birth control. “Oh, let’s not talk about birth control. We can’t do that. The church doesn’t accept it.” “Well, are we having sex?” “Well, just with my boyfriend.” “Okay, okay. Well, you know when you have sex, you can get pregnant.” “No, no, no, you only get...you only – what was it? – you only get...ah, when you get pregnant, it’s a gift from God. And so when it’s His decision and I know he won’t, because it’s not time,” you know. Yeah, so it’s kind of wishing, you know. This little wishing away pregnancy. ",
,,"So then we started talking about how did...how do we get pregnant, when do we get pregnant, and...and what...what is birth control? What are some of the birth control that doesn’t work. Because if there was birth control it was a withdrawal, and that doesn’t work. And so we found out just why it doesn’t work, you know. And so we started reading Our Bodies, Ourselves. And then we said, whoa! We don’t know nothing. So all of a sudden...now, this might sound really silly. But all of a sudden, we were all interested in our cervix. What is a cervix? And, ah, why is this important. When is it different so that you do get pregnant, and you...and when it...when you don’t get pregnant? And then when we finally saw that pictures of the cervix, we said, oh, my God! A baby has to come out of that? You know. I mean, it’s just a little...just a little curly-cue, just a little mouth. It’s like the head of a penis, you know. And if a dude ever thought that that head of the penis was going to open up to bring out a baby, maybe he’d think twice, if he had any empathy for another, okay. That’s given, maybe, empathy. But, so then we go...baby comes out of that? That’s got to hurt! [laughter]",
,,"So on this level we were learning about your bodies, you know, and about the cycle of the egg and sperm and how it can travel up the leg after you withdraw. And we were, it’s just amazing. Well, then they would talk to their boyfriends, or they would talk about it. They started talking about it in a mixed group in MEChA. “No, no, no, no!” you know. And then they wanted the guys to know so they could become responsible too, and there would be this joint decision as far as, you know, when you’re messing around, you know, having sex, or having a meaningful moment that you both understand what you’re...what the...when to do it, not to do it, and why it’s going to happen. But they weren’t interested in it. It was too embarrassing. They didn’t want to talk about it.",
,,"Well, you know what? I, now, at this point, I didn’t know how much they knew about their body. It was only later that I thought, “You know, I wonder just how much they know, how comfortable they were in talking about their own body. Because if we are just learning, they probably didn’t know anything more than we did. So, um, and, you know, you’re often uncomfortable if people are talking about things you don’t know. You don’t want to show your ignorance. So...so I look back and I said, maybe that wasn’t just about men not wanting to be responsible and turning it off, but maybe it was had to do with, one, making them realize they didn’t know about themselves, and making them real—and...and being uncomfortable with the women knowing something that they didn’t know. They wouldn’t be on equal terms. ",chicanos; education
,,"But I don’t know if that was true, you know. I often speculate why things happen. Ah, because, um...these are guys you know. They’re...they’re not like the “male” or the male establishment. These are guys you know. You’re the same age, you’re coming in at the same time, you’re growing up at the same time. And you’re going through those milestones, developmental milestones at the same time. So I figure the milestones we went through, they must have...probably were going through those milestones also, but without the curiosity or encouragement to, you know, hit those milestones. They weren’t...they weren’t going in that direction. ",
,,"So that’s...that’s kind of like the background of how the woman’s thing is. So all these issues, then we started reading. Not just me, but the women in this...beginning of this...we called this (Hermanas Unidas 40:30). And it was the committee. We also made menudo, and we were the fundraising arm of MEChA. We raised money. Would, you know, make menudo and salads so that they could raise enough money for the newspaper to go out. Or, um, money to...I just remember for using for the newspaper. I don’t know what other roles we...we raised funds in. And so as these different issues came up, we would start reading.",
,,"You know, unfortunately, we didn’t have a Google. So we couldn’t look up abortion, or birth control, or this or that. So we would figure out, well, where do we begin? And, you know, like the experience at the Emergency Hospital, I looked up abortion myself. I wanted to know what it was. What were the issues. I found out about...and abortion was still illegal at that point in California. And, ah, where is there help, there was underground help for people who had underground...unwanted pregnancies. So, and then, you know, we learned about (? 41:38) control. That’s how we found out about Our Bodies, Ourselves. We just would go to the library. We’d go to the bookstore. And there wasn’t a whole lot. You know, like you could find it easy. ",feminism
,,"And so then we even, um, would talk to...there was NOW. And we’d look at NOW, but...So NOW was talking about health issue—Oh, there was Ms., Ms. Magazine. And Ms. Magazine always had a section on health, birth control. And it tried to have something that was going on in the community, in the minority women’s community. Not always, but that was...that was a...a resource, in that they would tell us what the issue is. And then we would know more to go work about...work on it. And then...then the women would go and talk to their parents. They’d talk to their mothers, you know. When did they ever use birth control? Did they ever have an abortion? Ah, did they ever have a child out of wedlock? And it turns out mostly everybody got pregnant before they got married, they’re parents, right? And, this was...this was no shame, because they married the parents, they married the father, and they had twenty years later, you know, they’re still together. But abortion, or birth control, then they saw how, um-um, moms weren’t talking. Pops, “I don’t want to hear that in the house at all.”",
,,"Ah...grandmothers, grandmothers would talk more than moms, you know. So grandmas were a...a key resource to the girls, okay. And they may or may...it depended on the grandmother. Some shared more than others. Ah, but then they realized, this isn’t just...I’m not just having these problems because I’m a college kid, okay. And I’m going, moving into the middle class. These are problems that my family has had. And because of those problems, it made a major difference in their lives, and it decided whether they did this or that. So that began to make them feel normal. There was always this need to feel normal. Because there was one, the guilt about being in college, you know. God, they had guilt about having to only share their bathroom, if they were in the dorm, they only shared the bathroom with one person, and they would think of their parents or their families, their brothers and sisters, you know. And so they had all these little luxuries that families didn’t. And they felt this guilt. So like, one more thing to feel guilty about. So very important to, you know, find out that they were still being normal. This was normal. This part of growing up as a woman and it happens to...it’s a common thing.",
,,"And so once we started learning of that, then we started writing about it. We did more research. We would write about it. We’d write about it in the...in (? 45:09) Grande for MEChA...the MEChA newspaper, we would write about it. I started writing about it in La Raza newspaper. But it was just the writings really reflect a growing awareness. ",
,,"So, um, so that’s...that’s how the woman question began, you know. It was really a men’s idea [laughs]. We may have done it or not, I couldn’t tell you, you know. But Corinne and I, we were...we wanted to make the organization a success, and the men felt that this was important, and we felt it was important. So we did it. Um, and as a result, that’s what came out. A long story.",
,I,It was a great story.,
,I2,"Yes, it’s a good breaking point too.",
,I,Yeah. Let’s break.,
,I2,You want to ask another question?,
,I,"No, we can break.",
,I2,"I mean, were you going to...were you about to ask...?",
,I,"Well, I...I just...No, I wanted to make a comment, that listening to your story, it’s so interesting to see the path. But you’ve got to stop...",
,I2,I’ve got to go outside [laughter].,
,I,You’re exiled.,
,R,[laughs],
,I,You’re out of this organization! [laughter],
,I2,I think it has (? 46:22).,
,R,She can put it on mute. Just put it on mute.,
,I,"Yeah, put it on mute. Um...this shift, um, from the path to Concienticacion, right, which is first forming a caucus, understanding the issues, or beginning to understand the issues. And then, um, and...and learning, sharing amongst the women, and multi-generational sharing too, or not. And then reading. And then writing.",
,R,Uh-huh.,
,I,"And that is just very, um...it’s a very powerful story, actually. Um, and I’m very interested also in, you know, what texts become...really important key texts and Our Bodies, Ourselves, I was very surprised, and...and, you know, I find that very interesting that that’s the text that is sort of speaking to women. But it’s because if there’s one thing that is similar, it does unite women across different class and race lines, it’s this question of taking control of...of knowledge about your body.",
,R,Um-hum.,
,I,"And I was also very interested to hear your thoughts on men and how there’s...It struck me, I never thought of it before, but in the entire, you know, period of the women’s liberation movement, there is no...",
,Part 2:,,
,I,"So, um, you were talking about just now, Hermanas Unidas. And so what shifted from Hermanas Unidas, ah, to Las (? Gordano 00:32)? And how did that happen, that shift?",
,R,"Well, it came from the research. Okay, it came from the research and writing, the need to write. At that time, there was the model that I learned in MEChA, and it was, again, even further reinforced in La Raza, is that there was the Chicano Press Association. And there was a need to write what was going on, and to get it printed, to share it with, you know, your...the...the specific audience. But also to disseminate it and to find out if the same things happen in other places. And, ah, Enriq—Enriqueta Vasquez always had a article in El (Greto 1:25) that addressed one woman’s issue or another. And it was so important to...Oh, that was the other thing is that, while in our research we would...there was...we always had access to Chicano press newspapers. They were always coming into the MEChA office. And we could see that this was...this was happening everywhere else – these questions, what the women were thinking, what the guys were thinking, what were the problems. And, ah, so we knew that the model for mobilization and raising awareness, and...we didn’t use the word self esteem, but a positive sense of self, and a sense of self determination, was to communicate with one another, and to communicate with men and women, you know.",
,,"                So I was doing...So we had talk about doing a newspaper, so that we could, um...just that women on campus, show their art, share their idea—we realized we needed to hear what women thought. Okay. So we wanted to share what we were learning, and also what we were thinking in a newspaper. Because that’s what we did in those days. And so, ah, we were doing different research. And this was a big step, just this idea. Because, one, the women would have to rebuilt themselves. I never under—I never went through that. I had no idea why other than, ah...it’s not the way my mother things or my aunt thinks, or...I don’t even remember my girlfriends thinking that in high school. So...so I didn’t have any empathy for that, because I didn’t go through that. You know, usually empathy comes from your own experience. But then I realized that...",hijas; feminism
,,"                So we had decided we’re going to put poems in. We’d like to put artists’ work in. We were going to put research articles in. We were going to put Chicana thought in, what they thought about whatever they thought, whatever issue they wanted to write about. And, um, so that we became rather than...we went from development and training to mobilization, really. But I didn’t...you know, we didn’t call it that, but looking back, that’s what I see it as. And so we each had our project. ",
,,"And, ah, then I saw that, um, this was hard. This was...Even though the women...There were several stumbling blocks. One, to let other people know what they’re thinking. “Hm...I don’t know how I feel about that.” Women artists, you know, women who were going to be artists. Other people were going to be artists. Other people were going to see them ultimately. If you’re going to be artists, ultimately it’s going to be seen one way or the other. “Hm...I don’t know I’m ready for that,” you know. Ah, they all...so it was the issue of rebuilding themselves, having to face the consequences of it. Like artists, are they going to like what I wrote...what...my picture? You know. Nothing political. Just are they going to like it. My poems. It’s personal. You know, do...”What’s going to be the feedback, and how am I going to feel about it?”",
,,"So we had to have constant communication just to encourage and support ourselves in completing the work, because there was...it was a new experience. You know, the only person who had seen our work is the teachers. You know, maybe not even our parents. So teachers are anonymous people. But when you actually put your name on it...So then they talked about using pseudonyms. Not everybody was ready to do that. So that was...that was stage one, getting there. And then stage two was deciding what they were going to write about. Stage three was going back to stage one. Oh, you know, do I really want to do it. ",
,,"And then I had, um – I don’t remember how – but I had stumbled on this, um...book called...hah, I forgot. I told (May Lee 6:17). That was a hundred years ago. But there was this book on Mexico, Mexican history. And there was there a segment about the Flores Magon brothers. And in that, there was a segment totally on the women’s role during that revolution. And they talked about Hijas de Cuauhtemoc, and how they worked to support. And they were a supportive arm and a fundraising arm, and they also had a newspaper, a newsletter. And they were doing all kinds of things. And I was very excited, because, again, it makes us normal, you know. There’s this whole goal of trying to normalize who you are and what you’re doing. So we shared it. We talked about at one of our meetings. And we read it, and we were just like all bug-eyed, and...Because the feeling that you’re normal is such a wonderful feeling, you know [laughs]. And so, um, and it was very interesting, and we wanted to know more. And so we decided that, ah, we would use Hijas de Cuauhtemoc for the name of the newspaper. ",
,,"We didn’t really call ourselves Hijas, okay? That was the name of the newspaper. Because we would be, ah...following in the footsteps of this organization. And that’s...So the...the newspaper was to commemorate and continue the work of Hijas de Cuauhtemoc. It was people who called hijas, okay? Only it wasn’t like Cuauhtemoc. So, um...so that’s how...how that...that came about. And so...and we...",hijas
,,"So the first newspaper was about the women at Cal State Long Beach, who they were, what they thought, what their talent was, etcetera. And then the reception was absolutely negative. I would say tsunami. Tsu—complete rejection. Completely rejection. Personally, in the public life, in the private life. Just, you know...And everybody regretted having their names and their work represented. ",
,,"Now I’ve got to tell you now, we’re talking about artwork that might be a portrait, you know. Um...hm, not a painting, but with pencil. I forgot what that’s called. But, you know, just a portrait of a face, a woman’s face. A hand [laughs]. I mean, very enigmatic kinds of stuff. Um, but it...it was traumatizing. It was traumatizing. Tsunamic trauma. Who are these hijas? What are you guys trying to do? What did you mean when you said this on this line? What is this picture all about? What did you mean when you said this on this line? I mean, you were on the carpet. And it’s like, you know, ah, looking at every work that President Obama says, you know, and asking for an explanation. Even the “uhs” you know. So, ah, it was...it was from ordinary hostile environment to super hostile environment. ",
,,"Did we think of leaving? Nah, you know. These are the dudes, that’s the way they are, you know. Life goes on. So, um...then we...and we continued. We continued to work within the organization, be the fundraisers, have the meetings, do training, and Corinne and I tried to encourage the women to become public speakers. So they would, whatever they did research in, or if they just wanted to talk, we would give...we would say, “Whatever you want to do, when you...when we meet next time, who wants to speak?” Okay. And so you get experience. Because it’s not easy to speak in front of a group. But we all know each others. But it’s important. You have something valuable to say. ",
,,"So we would practice public speaking. And being part of UMA, I mean, the EOP, ah, we would go speaking to Kiwanis Clubs, to, ah, Mexican American Senior Citizens Clubs. We would go to a lot of places to raise money for scholarships. So we would encourage them to come with us, and then to go on their own. And so we would try to do that kind of process of development.",
,,"Then we heard about the National Women’s Conference in Houston. And we said, how can we go to that conference to talk about Chicana thought, and we don’t even know what we’re thinking around here? You know? I mean, we just found out what we’re thinking here in the campus. And that’s just a small group of women. We don’t know what everybody else is thinking – just the new Chicana students or this or that. Or the Chicanas from...is there a difference between those Chicanas who came from (Bisadia 12:06), and those Chicanas who came from East LA, you know. We could see that there’s all different diversity there among the women. And...and then, of course, we’re college women, you know, so that’s a very small segment. So what about other women? ",
,,"So at that time, I had been...become working, and really being mentored by Francisca Flores and Regeneracion. And that whole group that she had. It was like, um...that’s as close as I think I ever came to a café society, where a group of thinkers – not thinkers – a group of people came to share about what they thought, what they questioned, and practiced it, you know. And see what...what...what it sounded like. And then we would continue that dialogue. And you’d be growing along that, you know. And so Francisca had that group of writers that she had established around herself. And the people who put out the Regeneracion. ",
