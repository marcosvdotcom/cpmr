,MC," And now we get to begin. Thank you so much, Enriqueta, for talking to us for this project and for contributing your story to it. Um, I’ve told you a little bit about the Chicana por mi Raza project and, really, what we are very interested in is more than just interviews, right? Or focus on one thing or one event. We’re interested in life stories and the life story of the political development and how that life story reflects the political development of chicanas, at the intersection, really, of the Chicano Civil Rights Movement and the Women’s Movement, the Feminist Movement. So, um, given that that’s our interest, we really begin, kind of, whenever you think the beginning of that political development is, uh, one of the first questions we generally ask is for you to describe your family life and your earliest memories. Your early years. Um, and what we’re interested in is whether or not you, in your opinion, if you grew up in a traditional family in terms of gender roles, religion, social values, or, you know, if there were any relatives or friends that seemed to kind of embody early on for you a challenge to those values. You know, what was your life like, really, as a child? And, uh, what was your family life like? Where was the beginning of this story for you?",
,EC," Well, I was born in Tucson, Arizona and my father’s family is part Yaqui and they’re from Benson, Arizona, uh, miners. And, um, my father’s family has been in the United States for many generations. So, my father was an English speaking person, spoke some Spanish because his mother spoke Spanish, but grew up in the United States. His parents grew up in the United States and their parents, so it’s many generations down. Uh, he met my mother in Calexico. My mother is from Sinaloa, México and, uh, they met and got married and then moved back to Tucson. My father had already been married once before and had two daughters from the previous marriage and had been in a car accident and his first wife and his son were killed in the car accident. They were run over by a car coming down a mountain or something like that. Um, so I have two half sisters and then in my family with my mother it’s myself and a younger sister. So there’s four girls, uh, the two half sisters they basically were raised by my grandmother and my aunt, uh, lived with us on and off but not very much. So our family was a very traditional family. When I was a year and a half or so we moved back to Calexico and basically that’s where I grew up, um, stayed there the rest of my life, uh, my mother pretty much stayed home and cared for us and my father worked different jobs. ",
,,"Uh, I remember in the summers we would go up to Fresno to pick grapes and they knew a rancher there and our family and a couple other cousins— it was about three families— we would, together, travel up there probably in June, July and stay until about October, November. You know, uh, picking grapes and then doing la pasa. You know, turning over the grapes and I remember doing that until I was about fourteen years old. And then after that I said, “I don’t want to do that kind of work. I never want to do that kind of work again.” So I really worked hard at my studies and studied really hard because I knew that I wanted not to have to work that kind of work, so physical. I remember, uh, back then we did not have drinking water on the fields. This is before César Chávez, we did not have toilets, um, the planes would fly over us and spray the grapes while we were working. So conditions were very primitive. Um, and those are the conditions that César Chávez was fighting for to change. So, um, but when you’re a child you don’t think about that. ",
,,"I remember them as good times, happy times, because I was with my family. So, um, I tried very hard in school, did very well, graduated with very good grades. I was in the, definitely the top 10 percent if not the top five percent of my class. I had mostly A’s, took the most challenging classes that I could. Um, I always had, um, a love for math and science. Those were my subjects that I really enjoyed. Um, I entered science fairs and did math— entered math contests and so forth and did fairly well. Uh, in high school the majority of the kids were chicanos or Latinos. Um, but the town was basically run by Anglos. The small group of Anglos, they were the owners and the ranchers. In high school I never had a Mexican teacher. I had one Latino teacher which was in Español, for Spanish, and that was it. And that was my experience of— ",
,MC, He was Spanish? ,
,EC," He was Spanish, from Spain. Oh, yeah. And, um, but overall I was a pretty good student so I didn’t have a lot of problems with my teachers. I tried very hard, did very well, and did not really know much about college. Neither of my parents went to college. My father, I think, had like a six or seventh grade education and my mother had maybe a fifth grade education. So their educational background was very limited. They knew how to read and they knew how to write, and they knew, you know, the basics of what you needed to survive at that time. My mother never spoke English. Uh, she tried to learn how to speak English and my father would make fun of her and, so, she just gave up. It’s sad but (laughs) he did wrong. So, um, in a way it was good, in a way it was bad, because it was difficult for her to maneuver herself, you know, through society here. But, it forced us to learn how to speak Spanish, you know? We had to speak Spanish. And, so, you know, I grew up in a household where we spoke Spanish to my mother and English to my father, which was interesting, but we learned how to speak Spanish. Uh, I remember my first culture shock was when I started kindergarten, uh, like I said, I never really had any Mexican teachers. They changed my name from Enriqueta to Henrietta. And I hated it. I mean, I just hated it, you know? ",
,EC,"So, through all my schooling in Calexico, I was Henrietta until I went to college and I changed it back to Enriqueta and I said, “No. Enriqueta.” You know? So, um, those are the kinds of challenges. Um, they were very subtle kinds of racism that I experienced that, you know, I wasn’t that aware of because they were so embedded into the system. Of course, now it’s a little more covert, uh, but you know there were things that I noticed. Um, so high school was pretty general, you know, did my best, worked hard at it, did well, and, um, never really knew about college until my senior year. I think it was, yeah, the summer of my going into my senior year or thereabouts. And one of the parents of one of my friends, um, she was in the same grade I was, got us together at his home and talked to us about college. I think there was about 10 or 12 of us. And he showed us how to fill out the college applications and to take the SAT and, you know, what we needed to do. And my parents were not wealthy. My father worked, you know, in the fields in the summer and as a mechanic, ran a gas station, did odd jobs, worked on highways, you know, so it wasn’t anything permanent or anything that he necessarily got a pension from. It was, you know, later years he lived off his social security. ",
,"Um, and, anyway, so this parent got us together and, um, helped us sign up for the SAT, took the SAT, and, to my surprise, did very well. And then San Diego State accepted me and offered me a grant and, you know, I qualified for Cal Grant and Pell Grant and all those different grants. ",,
,MC, What year was this?,
,EC, That was my senior year. ,
,MC," So, do you remember what year— was this in the early—",
,EC, ’68. ’67 or ’68. ,
,MC," 1967, ’68 and what do you think— ",
,EC, Because I graduated in ’68.,
,MC," Wow, so that’s a really important time to come to San Diego, I would imagine. It’s right when things are really getting hot. ",
,EC," Well, in ’68 we were the first large class, or, you know, visible class to be accepted to EOP. Because EOP has just started that year. ",
,MC," Right, and EOP is the Equal Education— ",
,EC," Opportunity Program. Uh huh. But, the hardest thing was convincing my father to let me leave. Uh, he did not want me to leave. My sister had already left because she got pregnant when she was 15 and, uh, she left the family and moved in with her husband’s family. She got married and then he was shipped off to Vietnam. He was a paratrooper. And, so, she was gone before I was and she was younger than I was. So, you know, my parents didn’t want me to leave at all. And I remember struggling with that a lot. ",
,MC, So your mother also— ,
,EC, Oh yeah. ,
,MC, She was— ,
,EC, Yeah. They knew education was important but to them keeping their daughter in the home was more important than education. ,
,MC, Why do you think that is? ,
,EC," I think they did want to feel the loneliness of being by themselves and they wanted to keep me there as long as they could. My father offered to buy me a car and, you know, he bribed me all kinds of ways and he would tell me that, you know, women didn’t need an education because they were gonna get married and raise a family and, I mean he tried all kinds— (laughs). You know, all the traditional mexicano things that the mexicano men, you know, the trips that they put on you, you know? Trying to— “No, you don’t need to do that.” You know? (Laughs). ",
,MC," So, why do you think that you could resist— I mean, it must have been very difficult. ",
,EC," Oh, yes. ",
,MC," Because these are your parents, you love them. ",
,EC," Oh, yeah and I cried and I cried and I said, “Why, I hope I’m making the right decision.” And, uh, finally I said, “I have to.” ",
,MC, Why? ,
,EC," I don’t know, it was just something in me. I didn’t want to have to work in the fields. I had done that before and I knew that if I had better preparation that I was gonna be able to have a better quality of life, not only for myself, but for my parents, which later on proved to be right because I was apply to help supplement their income and support them to some extent. Uh, so finally I did. I left to San Diego State in 1968. ",
,MC," And were they mad? I mean, how long did it take to— ",
,EC," No, they brought me up. ",
,MC," Oh, okay. ",
,EC," And we saw— I lived in the dorms. And, uh, they weren’t mad. They knew that it had to happen, but, you know, it was with reluctance. And, of course, I was very homesick, you know, the first year or so. But my family away from my home— and I didn’t know anybody here— became MAYA which is now MEChA. ",
,MC," Oh, okay, so tell me, how did that happen?",
,EC," And, luckily I ended up in a dorm in a wing where we were all Latinas from the Imperial Valley. My roommate was Vivian Zermeño, which is Sombra’s— do you know Sombra? She’s getting her doctorate at UCLA now. Her mother. I was, uh, with Maria Sanchez, Felicitas, uh, Silvia— we used to call her Chiva— Silvia Romero. Uh, Francisca and Socorro Rascón, two sisters from Calexico themselves. So we were all either from Brawley, el Centro or Calexico. And, so, that made it kind of nice because when we needed to go home to see our parents, you know, we could hitch rides with each other, ‘cause we didn’t have cars. We were all basically from low-income families. We were all there because of grants. The Pell Grant and the Cal Grants, you know? So, anyway, um, that’s how I came to San Diego State. Um, I joined MAYA and saw Maya is a comfort place. Comfortable place, um, and at the same time I was really learning. I was learning about who I was as a chicana, where I came from, stuff that I had never been introduced to because we were in, you know, the American type of school system that didn’t teach you anything about your history. I mean, your history was Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, you know? And nothing about Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz o Díaz Ordaz or, you know, nothing about México you learn. So I ended up learning all of that stuff at San Diego State. ",
,MC, In class or just amongst the students? ,
,EC," Well, amongst us and then we started with Chicano Studies, or Mexican American Studies. ",
,MC," Oh, so how did that happen? Who started that? ",
,EC," Well, we knew that we needed to learn more. And professors like, uh, Gus Agade [Tape 1a 5","27] and René Nuñez and, um, oh, he’s an anthropologist, Carlos Velez,uh, you know, were around teaching in the Spanish Department and in the, um, Anthropology Department. They started coming together and supporting us and mentoring us, and so it was born from there. Because basically in ’68 is when there was a visible amount of Chicanos coming in. There was, I think, that year is when oh about 50 of us came in. 50 or 60. Under EOP. And so, um, you know, we pretty much stayed together and developed different programs that we needed to support our needs at the university. "
,MC, So the university was willing to listen to you and a group of faculty? ,
,EC," Yes, to a certain extent. As long as it wasn’t gonna cost a lot. You know, so, when we were doing the volunteer stuff, no big deal, right? You know, but once we wanted to develop into a department and— we had to have demonstrations. And at the same time, in ’68, um, the Vietnam War and all the demonstrations that were taking place, um, the Black Panther Movement is strong, uh, the Women’s Movement was beginning to pick up. So, there were al— and of course, the Chicano Movement. So there were a lot of things— there was a lot of energy and a lot of movements happening. And it seems like they were building up around that time. And César Chávez. We were taking bits from all those different movements, you know, a lot of us were involved with the César Chávez movement and participated in the demonstrations. Especially the ones, the boycotts against grapes and Coors. Those were the big ones back then. So, um, so we started, um, Mexican American Studies at that time. And, uh, and then I think some of the women started noticing that the men were taking over. You know, like they were in the other movements. So, some of us said, “Hey, we want a voice too.” And— ",
,MC," So did you— you mentioned earlier when we were just talking you went up until ’68, I guess it was in ’69— was it ’69 in Denver? ",
,EC, Mhmm. ,
,MC," Uh, I’m curios to know how you managed to go from San Diego to Denver without a car and who you went with and what that was like. Do you remember what that was like? ",
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC," Yeah? So, how? ",
,EC, We went in a bus. We chartered a bus. And there was a big group of us. I’d say probably 50 or 60 of us. Yeah. It was a big group. ,
,MC, From San Diego? ,
,EC," From San Diego, yeah. We pulled in people from City College and some of the other universities that wanted to go with us and, you know, everybody paid a little bit of money and we got together and we went. And when we went we were actually MAYA. And once we went to Denver we became—we adopted the name of MEChA. And— ‘cause there were already MEChAs throughout different parts of the country and, so, we wanted to make a name that was gonna unify us, you know, instead of separate names, different places. And, so, uh, for a little while we were MAYA- MEChA and then we dropped off the “MAYA” and stayed with “MEChA.” But I think that was a big turning point for some of the chicanas from San Diego. Um, I think a lot of people were looking at chicanas at San Diego because we were pushing forward and, um, we were, um, asking for equality with the chicano guys. ",
,MC," Uh huh. As early as in the late 1960s, and so you think that the Denver— what happened at the Denver Youth Conference? ",
,EC," At the Denver Youth Conference it was very interesting because I think that was the turning point for many of us. We saw that the only people in the kitchen were the women. The, the women were the ones taking care of the kids in the childcare center. The women were the ones taking notes in all the workshops. And when you looked at the workshops, they were all being run by men. It was the chicano man that was the keynote speakers and speaking up there in the front and, you know, putting out the ideas, and the women were just sitting back, we’re just kinda, you know, taking it. And so, a group of us said, “No. We’re gonna boycott this conference until you change it.” And so we had a Chicana Caucus. We called it right there, got into a room and we said, “No. We are not gonna take care of the kids, we’re not gonna be cooking, until you give us equal power.” They said, “Men have children, too. They need to be out there.” And, so, until they granted us that equality and accepted, you know, what we were proposing, you know, we were not gonna participate. And, so, the first couple of days— I think the conference was four or five days. So the first couple of days were just checking things out, you know, “What the hell is goin’ on here?” You know? (Laughs). ",
,"And then se nos prendió el foquito, you know, and we said, “Wait a second, this is not right.” And so then that’s when, uh, you know, we put our demands the last few days and when we came back we were all fired up. ",,
,MC, Do you remember some of those demands?,
,EC," Oh, gosh, you know what? I was very good at taking notes. And everywhere I went I always took notes. I even wrote down the names of the people that were at different meetings or at different conferences. I wrote down what we ate, um, I even still have the little badge and my lunch ticket for that conference. But, unfortunately I don’t have all that in my head. But they are in the archives. ",
,MC, So your notes from the Denver Youth Conference are in the archives? ,
,EC," Yes, they are. ",
,MC, We need to go get that. ,
,EC," Yeah, they’re right in there. And it has some of the notes of some of the demands that we had. But basically it was, you know, to be— to have equal representation in presenting ideas, you know? And being part of the workshops. Not just being the workers, but also being able to be part of the, you know, the leadership. And, so, when we came back, like I said, we came back pretty fired up. And we said, “You know what?” She says, “And we’re going to be asking for equal representation and equal rights in some of these things. We need to know what we’re talking about. We need to know the issues. We need to be political ourselves. We need to know that what we're saying is something that is going to be good for everybody.” And, so, then we started having workshops or classes for ourselves. ",
,MC, For chicanas. ,
,EC," Si, uh huh, for our chicanas. And at that time one of the things that I was really interested in— ‘cause my major was health. You know, I had always wanted to study medicine but I ended up going into community health, which I really liked. And one of the things that I did, I don’t know if you remember that book, Our Bodies Ourselves? ",
,MC, Mhmm. ,
,EC," That kind of became my Bible. And a lot of young chicanas were getting pregnant… and what was happening to them is that they would get pregnant and they would have to drop out of school and, you know, take care of the children, and usually the guy would just disappear. And, so, one of the things that was also beginning around that time was birth control, okay? And, so, I really got into giving classes on birth control— our bodies. Many young chicanas didn’t know what a vagina was or where their ovaries were or what the function of those things were and that they had control of that. You know? And so I became a real advocate. And every time we would have our classes or our circulo or our little group meeting, I would take the first 15 to 20 minutes and I would do a lesson on, “Okay, today we’re gonna study something from Our Bodies Ourselves.” Whether it was the psychology part of it or the medical part of it or the anatomy, but I would do presentations. And I have some pictures where I’m standing (laughs) I’m right there with my posters, you know, of the vagina and the fallopian tubes and the— (laughing). ",
,"It sounds ridiculous but I mean, that needed to happen because we hadn’t gotten that from our parents, and we really needed to take care of ourselves before we could, you know, get out there and start taking care of other people, you know? So, um, that was one of the things that I pushed for, you know, was helping young girls know who they were physically and to have control of their bodies and their mind. ",,
,MC," And did you— so when you talk about these workshops, they were going’ on with San Diego State students, women, were they happening through like a— did you develop an organization or was it just—? ",
,EC," Just a, “Hey, we’re gonna—“ ",
,MC," A grupo, a círculo. ",
,EC," Un grupo, un círculo, yeah. “Okay, we’re gonna have our meetings every Wednesday, they MEChA meetings are on Thursdays so on Wednesdays the women are gonna get together.” And we would go over the agenda that was gonna be presented at the MEChA meeting so that when it was presented we knew what they were talking about. So that it wouldn’t be totally controlled by the guys. ",
,MC, And was it at that time? ,
,EC," Oh, yes, oh, yes, oh, yes. Very much so. I remember one meeting— and I think, Sonya, I’ll tell you about this. There was this one guy and he wouldn’t let anybody talk. And some of the women wanted to say something and he wouldn’t let them talk. And, remember I told you I had taken karate? I was a red belt Taekwondo. And, um, you know, I felt pretty strong, you know, in mind and body (laughs). And, so, myself and a couple other women went and picked up the guy and removed him from the room and threw him outside and closed the door so we could keep going with our meeting. ",
,MC, And what did the other guys think about that?,
,EC," Oh, they were just like, “What the hell’s going on here?” “Respeto!” (Laughs) Oh, God. We were wild. I mean, we were— I mean, but, you know? We were trying to be ourselves, and given the opportunity that any other person would have, without being put down. You know? So— ",
,MC," And, so, I’m curious about this because a couple of things— we’ll just take a little aside because, you know, Anna Nieto Gomez, when we did our interview with her, she also talked about Our Bodies Ourselves. ",
,EC, Yes. ,
,MC," And I think it’s very interesting because a lot of times the way that we sort of think about Chicana Feminist History is almost as antagonist. And that is true that there were moments of antagonism and power struggles with the white women just as there were with the brown men. Um, but I think that what gets lost in that narrative a lot of times is the important— you know, the tools the Feminist Movement actually gave chicanas to intervene in their own situation, their political situation. ",
,EC, In our way. ,
,MC," Exactly, yeah. ",
,EC," In our way. Because a white woman could not have done the same thing. You know, uh, a white woman could not come in and tell us what to do because it would have never worked. As it was we were already getting a lot of criticism from the chicano men for listening to the white women or reading, uh, some of their stuff, like, uh, oh gosh, a lot of Gloria Steinem stuff was coming out at that time and there were other women that were putting out literature at that time and we were reading it. As part of our groups we were reading it. But in our grupo, like I said, I would usually start it off with something like that, but there were other things going on. Like, for example, Felicitas had her interest in the arts, and Viviana. And they wanted a teatro. They wanted not only to talk about this stuff but to act it out and show it. And then Olivia with her music and her guitar wanted to sing it. You know, so it wasn’t just this part of it but it was, it was pretty— you know, there was historical, it was enlightening in terms of our head, um, it was meeting our heart through our music, you know, and theatre. And, so, it had a lot of different branches because the women that were involved in the group had interests in all different areas. And I think that’s what made us richer. I think that’s what made us, you know, more balanced. And I think that, you know, like Anna, you know, and the women up in San Francisco, Dorinda, you know— that I can’t remember all the names but I remember them. And Maggie, you know, and…",
,MC, So how did you know all these women? What were the networks like? Like how did you,
,[XXX9,03 Tape 1b],
,EC," We started going to MEChA conferences, you know, in different places. And then in ’69 was when we started CHE. Because we needed— what was happening— the fight for Mexican American Studies was not just us at San Diego State but it needed to happen throughout the state. And the battle that we were having were the same battles that other people were having up and down the state. So, um, Chicano Council for Higher Education came in and, um, that’s how we started meeting other people. Well, of course, first through the MEChA conferences. We went to women’s conferences, we went to the MAYA Conference, um, then I did that internship in the Raza Unida Party in Crystal City. And, so, all those connected me with different people. And other people were doing other things too, you know? So we were meeting— “Ay, have you heard of this person?” Have you heard of that person?” You know, “They have some good ideas.” And, so, we started borrowing ideas from each other and building on them, and knowing that we had support somewhere else, too. You know? That we weren’t acting alone, not only as women and as chicanas, but as chicanos in the development of Mexican American Studies into Chicano Studies. ",
,"And CHE, I think, was real instrumental in the development of Chicano Studies because that’s what it was set up for. Um, and what we would do is, actually we would have four conferences going on at the same time and it was like a two-day conference, and, so you would come up on Saturday and there were four segments. It was a segmental conference. So you had your private colleges, your universities, your state colleges and your community colleges. If we were meeting here in San Diego, then we brought in those satellites. They met by themselves, uh, segmented, um to discuss where were the Chicanos, what were some of the hassles that you were having, how’s the implementation of Chicano Studies coming along, um, are you supporting your chicano students on campus, are they getting what they need to maintain and stay there and finish out? And this was going on in the four levels. And then on Sunday we would come back all together, all four of us, and sometimes we had, you know, up to 300 people. And we would share, you know, what the resolutions or the findings that everybody had. And then from there, nació el Plan de Santa Bárbara. They said, “You know we need to come up with a real, set plan.” And, you know, el Plan de Santa Bárbara is basically supporting Chicano Studies and, you know, giving it its substance. ",,
,MC, So that was a CHE Conference at Santa Bárabara? Is that right? ,
,EC, No. It wasn’t. No. It was el Plan de Santa Bárbara. ,
,MC," Right. It happened at a conference, right? ",
,EC," Yeah it was, uh— but I don’t think it was a CHE. I think it was something to do with MEChA. ",
,MC," Right, because, I think, did CHE come after the MEChA? Does that sound right? ",
,EC, Yes. ,
,MC, Okay. That must be. ,
,EC, Yeah ,
,TAPE 1C,,
,MC," Yeah, that’s really interesting. One of the things that interests me so much about this project, having interviewed women all over the country, right? Well, not all over the country. Southwest and Michigan and Illinois. Uh, was the networks, how people were communicating because this was the time before— ",
,EC, And we didn’t have computers. ,
,MC," I know, you had to physically travel. ",
,EC, We didn’t have cellphones. We had to write. ,
,MC, Yeah. Reports. ,
,EC," We had to write. Oh, yeah. Uh, I know in CHE, when I was the president in I think it was ’70, ’71, and then I stayed— Renée [Tape 1c 0","46] was president I think ’69, ’70. And I think I was president ’70, ’71, ’72, ’73 ay por allí. I think I stayed in for three years. I stayed one extra year. Uh, we did a newsletter and we produced a newsletter every month. And we would get articles for different people from different places. And, uh, we would, you know, say this is what’s happening in the South, this is what’s happening in the central region, uh, and this is what’s happening in the North. And that’s how we communicated. But, no, there was a lot of movement going on. And those conferences were once a month. "
,MC, How did you get any studying done?,
,EC," (Laughs) Ay, you just did it. You just did it. ",
,MC, How did you graduate?,
,EC," And my major was— I had a double major. I had Community Health and Chicano Studies. And Spanish! And a minor in Spanish. I don’t know, I just did it. You know? ",
,MC, You did it in four years? ,
,EC, I did it in— no. I think I did it in five years. ,
,MC," Oh, five years. ",
,EC," Yes, because I also had a baby. ",
,MC, Oh my god. ,
,EC, And I also got married in ’69. So when I went to Crystal City I was already married. ,
,MC," So, okay, let’s uh— ",
,EC," And let me tell you, and that was interesting because I remember my husband— ",
,MC, When did you go? Let me put that down. ,
,EC, The summer of ’69. ,
,MC, Crystal City summer of ’69? ,
,EC, ’70. ,
,MC, Okay. ,
,EC," Yeah, because I got married in ’69 and it was that next year, ’70. And I remember my husband used to criticize, “But you’re married with her! ¿Por qué la dejas?” You know, and this and that. Well, let me tell the story about my husband and getting married to him. Well, my husband was a real macho from Texas. And as far as he was concerned the woman was gonna stay home and cook and take care of the kids, you know? Sin chanclas. (Laughs) Like they say, you know? But, um, that wasn’t me. ",
,MC, And he was a student here at SDS— ,
,EC," Yes, at San Diego State also. He left Texas right after graduation and joined the Navy, okay? And then went to the Navy and got trained— it was during the Vietnam War— but he got trained in the medical field. And he became a surgical technician and a urology specialist. And ended up working at the VA Hospital in San Diego. Okay? So he never was shipped away. I don’t think he’s ever been on a ship. Okay? But they kept him there. But he saw everything that happened in the Vietnam War. He was getting all the wounded soldiers. And he was at City College for two years and then transferred to San Diego State for the last two years. And that’s where we met. My husband’s about six or seven years older than I am. But anyway when we got married, um, we had a big battle. And he wanted me to cook and I hate to cook. Sorry, but I don’t cook. You know? I love to bake. But not cooking. And I told him, “No, I’m not cooking.” I remember the first huevos rancheros I made for him (laughs). I got the chile verde and I put it in the skillet and then I got the huevos and I put it on top and then I stirred it. And I said, “Here’s your chile rellenos.” (Laughs). ",
,"That’s my cooking, you know? And he, when he grew up he worked at a restaurant with his father as a cook because his father was one of the cooks. And he knew how to cook real good. I said you know what I don’t know why you want me to cook. You cook so much better than I do. I said I’ll wash the dishes, I’ll clean the house but I won’t cook. He says, “No, in my house you’re gonna cook.” And this and that and that’s how they do it in Texas. And I said, “Okay, bye bye.” Packed my bags and left. And I left to my girlfriend’s house. You know, at that time we were all pretty tight. And I was gone for three days and then, uh, the third day he comes knocking on the door and he says, “Can you come home.” He says, “I promise you I will cook for you for the rest of your life.” And until today he still cooks for me. ",,
,"So, in our home— ",,
,MC, You had a walkout! ,
,EC, I had a walkout. ,
,MC, You walked out. ,
,EC," I striked [sic] and I walked out. (Laughs) No. And, uh, in our home, I have four children. And our home, we both work full time, so we shared our duties in the home. He did not have a problem taking our kids to the doctor, washing clothes, cooking, and so our kids grew up with that. Uh, my kids, I have three boys and one daughter, they know how to cook, they know how to wash their own clothes, they know how to, uh, clean house, um, they know how to do everything. ",
,MC," Well, this is one of the great untold stories of the Chicano Movement, right? That it really drastically changed families. ",
,EC," Yeah, but, see, the woman’s consciousness or the chicana’s consciousness did not only happen with women. It happened with men too. Because as I was learning he was learning. And he, he has such a respect for women. It’s incredible. And I think it comes from what our relationship was. And I think that the women that were able to have those types of relationships with the chicano men, uh, you know, it was because the woman was a strong woman. And if you were not a strong woman, the man was gonna take over. ",
,MC," And the other thing that is very interesting to me is that, uh, you know, talking to other women, this idea that the Women’s Movement, the white Women’s Movement, uh, kinda created this line in the sand, right? So families were always patriarchal and there was no— you know, in a way you had to kind of reject the family system in order to move forward with the women’s movement and with rights and liberation for women. And with chicanas it was very different. ",
,EC," Oh yeah. Yeah, we were constantly asked, well, you have to pick. The Women’s Movement or the Chicano Movement. And I said, “Well, I can’t be in the Chicana Movement if I’m not a woman, so it has to be both.” You know? But the men were so angry, you know, that the women were gaining their consciousness and they were becoming— you know, they weren’t being subservient or below them. You know, they couldn’t control us. They had to treat us as equals and if they weren’t willing to treat us as equals we weren’t gonna have anything to do with them. And they, they had a hard time with that. But I think at that time they weren’t realizing that by us doing that, they were becoming stronger. And so many of the men that were with us at that time, I think did very well professionally when they moved on to their careers and their professions because they had been through that. And they learned how to respect women as equals and get along with them. Whereas, a lot of men don’t. Even white men don’t, you know? I see some of the things that are going on right now with the mayor of New York, our own mayor here in San Diego. And they do things with women or two women and they don’t realize that what they’re doing is wrong and disrespectful. And it’s because they’ve never had that consciousness, you know? They’ve never been taught. Neither by their mothers nor by their wives or partners. You know? It’s sad. ",
,MC," Well, I know it’s been the experience of my mother and many other women, that, just what you described. That it involved a radical transformation in the chicano family because many had grown up in very traditional families, you know? ",
,EC," Oh, my family was very traditional. ",
,MC, Speaking of which— ,
,EC, But I wasn’t. ,
,MC," I’d like to move on next to the Houston conference. You went to the Houston conference, the first national Chicana Conference.",
,EC, Mhmm. ,
,MC," So we were just talking about the actual of developing Chicano Studies and healthcare. So, did you want to talk a little bit about that?",
,EC," Well, when we wanted to move from Mexican American Studies to Chicano Studies, there was additional battles. Now, at this time we had, um, you know, círculos or groups that were meeting and the chicanas and the chicanos and, uh, gradually we started moving towards, uh, study groups. And, of course, there wasn’t a whole lot written about chicanas and chicanos. So we were trying to pick up on information that was being written about oppressed women in other countries. And, so, at that time we started reading some of the stuff that was coming out of China, um, Cuba, you know? About their movements and the plight of women and oppression and the history of oppression. And, so, we didn’t feel we had a lot of knowledge on that. So, we were developing study groups and these study groups were outside of the classroom because they were so radical that they would probably not be accepted in the classroom. And we were reading some of Marx’s stuff and Engels and Che Guevara stuff and Fidel Castro, and you know a lot of stuff that was coming out of other third world countries. And how they were dealing with oppression. Uh, oppression of people, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, for example, by Paolo Friere, you know, a lot of that kind of work. Uh, now it’s more accepted than it was in the early 70s, because that’s when this was all happening. So, uh, in the movement towards Chicano Studies and making it more refined, a lot of that theory was coming in. And there at that time were some chicanos that were very nationalist and wanted it to be only Mexican and only chicano. And then there was another group of us that were more, hey, you know, it’s about oppression. It’s oppression of a people, oppression of women, you know? ",
,MC, Third world struggles. ,
,EC," Uh huh, third world oppression. Um, look at what is happening to, you know, countries that are not part of the Superpower, you know, it was all that. And, so, it was taking, uh, a different political frame. And, so, there were people who were not for it. And we had professors in Chicano Studies that were nationalistic, we had students that were nationalistic, so there was a big struggle. You know, it was such a big struggle that, you know, towards the ’72 ‘73s there were splits and big fights, you know, big battles. And I think there were more philosophical fights, you know, where people were at different phases. And I remember myself for a long time I didn’t really care a lot for people that were very nationalistic because they weren’t inclusive and it took me a while to understand that that was a stage in development and that some people had to go through that to get to the next stage. And, uh, but back then I was young and I was just learning and I was excited about what I was learning and I wanted to implement what I was learning, not only in, you know, in my classes but also in the community. Because at the same time, you know, there were other things going on. We had a child care center for all our families that were going to college and we supported the child care center because we didn’t like what childcare centers were providing. You know, they weren't teaching the kids about their culture, they weren’t teaching them about their language, they weren’t teaching them about their history, you know? So, we went and found a house in the community and we rented it and we staffed it ourselves and we hired people and people would pay a little bit of money instead of paying at some institution, we were running it ourselves. ",
,MC, A childcare center in the community for students and for community members?,
,EC, Mhmm. ,
,MC," So, bringing the two groups together? ",
,EC," Yeah. And we also started the Barrio Station, which is still a big thing and that’s where we also had “la escuelita” and it was a school, you know, that children could go to to learn about different things. ",
,MC, And what was the Barrio Station?,
,EC," The Barrio Station is now a big recreation center and it’s run by a woman named Rachel Ortiz who is a very strong lady. Probably someone you should interview, too. They’re making a film on her. ",
,MC," Oh, really? ",
,EC," Yeah, she’s quite a lady. And, uh— ",
,MC," And was the Barrio Station, was that kind of, was it inspired by other models that you had seen during your development or—? ",
,EC," Well, you know, before the Barrio Station and the Chicano Health Clinic— ‘cause we also had a health clinic— we had the Chicano Federation. Okay? And these are all things that started from San Diego State, and it started from this group. So, you see it wasn’t just what we were doing on campus but there were a lot of stuff we were doing in the community. And, you know, sometimes we forget that a lot of these things that were going on also came from what we were doing. And the Chicano Federation was basically a group in the community that was kinda like, uh, an advocate in the community for chicanos. Chicano rights. Whether it was janitors or laborers or, you know, you could come to the Chicano Federation and present your, uh, what was going on and then, you know, we would try to do what we could. And we would bring in people from different organizations like MAPA, at that time, the Mac Project, uh, SER, there was an organization called SER. Uh, and so we had people from all of those different [organizations] sitting on the board and then we would have Chicano Federation meetings. And I remember having meetings where we had hundreds of people from the community, and it was students from all the segments and, uh, community people. And from there, the Barrio Station and the childcare center, the Centro Cultural, you know, were born. ",
,MC," Oh, and in Balboa Park. ",
,EC," Yeah, Chicano Park, you know, all those things— they were kinda all kinda related because it was some of the same people. And, so that was exciting. ",
,MC," And was that also in the same period, so ’69, ’70? ",
,EC," Uh huh, through ’74, around there. Anyway, so you know, um, Chicano Studies had a pretty big struggle, you know, uh, again like I said I took a lot of minutes. Uh, I was for a little while, I think for a year or so, the part-time secretary, I think. ‘Cause under EOP you get a part-time job, for Chicano Studies. So I worked there and actually when I graduated from college in ’74, or ’73, I also got accepted into a Master’s program in, uh, an MPH program. Masters of Public Health at UCLA. And I also got accepted to, uh, a Master’s in Science and Counseling. And at that time I had my daughter who was one year old, and I decided instead of going to LA, staying here in San Diego and pursuing the counseling. And, uh, so, I mean, that’s why, I guess, I went into counseling is because I stayed in the area. But I was gonna say something else y se me fue la honda. ",
,MC," I think it’s a good place to think about the differences between the Chicano Movement and how it sort of played out in Los Angeles vis-a-vi chicanas and here. Because it seems like those were two— even though you’re probably at this time in pretty good communication, there’s probably a lot of movement back and forth. ",
,EC," Oh, yeah. ",
,MC," Um, with Los Angeles, but, in your memory, were there any differences that you could see with what chicanas were doing in a place like LA and what you guys were doing here in San Diego? ",
,EC," Well, they had Comisión Femenil conferences and we would go to that and then they had, uh, Hijas de Cuauhtémoc was more of a publication, I saw it, and it wasn’t so much— you know? But whenever we got a chance we would, you know, we would get together and we would talk. And, I think, at that time, we saw a lot more similarities and we, I think we picked up on each other’s similarities more so that we could continue building on that than the differences. Um, so I don’t remember seeing a whole lot of differences other than that we were in a different location and we had, uh, different types of situations but it was like, “Have you gone through this?” And some of it was, uh, philosophical, you know, ideas and stuff like that. But some of it was, how do you deal with situations? You know, how do you move from here to here, you know? With men or with the system, or, you know, whatever you were dealing with, you know? And I think that we didn’t have that much time to deal with the differences, that we dealt more with the similarities and how we could help each other, you know, so when we met with other people in other places we took advantage of the time in exchanging ideas and making the best of it, because we knew we weren’t gonna be together that long. Than, we didn’t have that much fighting or any of that stuff. Not like here. You know, when we were home, that was different and there were more philosophical kinds of, you know, differences that we were having because of the different places that different people were at. And we always had new people coming in, you know, so they were coming from a different background, a different setting, a different—. But I remember that in our organization, we had, um, we had Anglos that actually joined us. And we actually had, um, African Americans, we had, you know, so there were people that really identified with us. ",
,MC, With the Chicano Federation or MAYA or— ,
,EC, MEChA. ,
,MC, In MEChA. ,
,EC," More so in MEChA than— Chicano Federation was more in the community. So that was definitely, you know, chicanos, but there were a lot of people who supported it. You know, in San Diego, you know, city officials and stuff like that because they saw it. It was kinda like an organization, like, uh, the Chamber of Commerce. You know you have the Mexican Chamber of Commerce, well it was the Chicano Chamber of Commerce, really. You know? It was kinda like that, that dealt with issues that were happening in the community with chicano families. ",
,MC, Were there Brown Berets here in San Diego? I’m assuming—,
,EC," Oh, yeah, my husband was a Brown Beret. And when we, um, uh, tried to get the college to accept Chicano Studies as a department, not just, you know, a couple of classes under the Spanish department or whatever department they wanted to put us, but our own department, we had demonstrations and took over the administrative building and it was the Brown Berets that took over the building and they were there for, a couple of days, I guess, and were arrested. And, the same thing with the neighborhood house, which, um, I was in health, and so I was one of the first people that also had worked in the neighborhood house trying to get, uh, medical services into that community because they had no medical services. And, um, and we also took over the neighborhood house and turned it into a clinic. ",
,MC," Which is still operational, right? ",
,EC," Which is very much a clinic and provides medical and dental services to the community, yes. ",
,MC, Great. And what is the name of the clinic again? ,
,EC, It’s the Chicano Health Clinic. ,
,MC," I went, um, I went to eat with Sonya and Gale and Rita at a Mexican restaurant close to there. They drove me by there and we also went to Chicano Park, so even all of these community development projects are arriving with, really, the Brown Berets, and sort of, so— student—so, community actors and student agents kind of coming together and making these things happen, right? So the split between student activists and community activists was not really operational? Or was there a lot of overlap? There wasn’t a split, I guess, I guess that’s what I’m asking. ",
,EC," I’m sure some people think that there’s a split, you know, uh, but I think that a lot of the stuff happened because we came together and we tried to keep the splits within ourselves, you know, and minimize them as much as possible. Like I said, there was definitely, you know, a giant split between the nationalists and, you know, some people called themselves Marxists at that time. ",
,MC, Third-Worldists. ,
,EC," Or third world. And so there was definitely, you know, a split there. But, I think eventually there was an acceptance of each other because of the different places that people needed to be at. But, it took time. It took time to heal, you know, and to work it out, you know? And I guess that’s part of the struggle. You know? That’s part of growing up, you know, and understanding where people need to be. But it was exciting. It was exciting times and it was a lot of hard work. You know, because at the same time we were still going to school, you know, I remember my last year I think I carried something like 27 units, you know? Because I wanted to get it done. And my master’s program I wanted to get it done in one year and two summers. ",
,MC," So, were you able to accomplish that? Let’s talk about the master’s program because you were doing work in the community and that was-- you were making it work for your master's program? Was there that kind of flexibility?",
,EC," No, at that time I was basically concentrated on my master's. But, the year before that, I was teaching in Chicano Studies. I became a full professor and taught, um, some chicanas classes, uh, I think I taught two chicana classes and then I co-taught two history classes. ",
,MC, And that would've been '73?,
,,,
,,,
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC, How did you teach a chicanas class?,
,EC," Well, I had-- ",
,MC, How did you get your materials?,
,EC," There were very few-- well, I had been collecting for a long time. Remember, all the study groups? You know, so I had all the third world stuff and we were doing study groups and-- ",
,[MIC GETS LOST], ,
,EC," You know, since we were asking to be a department, then they were asking for the professors to have degrees, you know? And just not anybody could come in and teach. Even though we had, you know, like José Villarino that taught the music class, and, you know, at that time he didn't have a degree. Or, we had people coming in and doing baile folklórico, you know? Things that, you know, you don't-- at that time degrees didn't exist in those subjects. Well, since I had graduated and I had one of the only Chicano Studies degrees, along with my, uh, health degree, because I mentioned that I was a double major, and they needed someone to teach that had the degree. So then that's when I went in and taught for a year. And this is the year right before I got into my master's program. And, uh, and so I did that. Um, but you know what? I did not find a shortage of materials. As a matter of fact, I had so much material, I did not have enough class for the material that I wanted to present because I had such a collection that I had been collecting for years. You know, women in political parties, you know, women in health, women in history, women in music, women in the arts. ",
,MC, And these are chicanas in particular? ,
,EC," Yes, yes. ",
,MC, And where did you-- you just collected these from meetings and conferences? ,
,EC," Yes, and from readings I had done, and, of course all the health classes. A lot of the health classes, you know, some of them presented stuff on women and I tried to take as many as I could of those classes so that I could bring those in, you know? The status of women's health not only in this country but in other countries. In third world countries, you know? And what were their life expectancy rates, what were the pregnancy rates, you know? At that time HIV, you know? Just all those different things. Um, so those, I mean, I did not have a shortage of material. I had so much material and I, you know, I didn't only bring in materials that had to do with chicanas but materials that had to do with third world women and white women, because some of the things white women were saying, you know, the, I remember talking about the image, the-- what was it called? The 6th avenue image that women had to have, you know, wearing high heels and the mini skirts, uh, The Second Sex, I think, talked about it. Where there was an image that women had to have to be successful in their careers, you know? And those were all missed, you know? And you didn't have to be like that, you know? And for us chicanas that was important, too. And, so for shortage of material, nunca. You know, as a matter of fact I had so much material that I did not have enough time to present it all. And, so, we always had extra group meetings or, you know, just to be able to cover everything that we wanted to cover, you know, 'cause there was so much there. And I think it's just, you know, it wasn't a narrow thing just on chicanas, you know, because you can't just be a chicana. You have to be a woman, you know? And then we were dealing with sex biases, too, you know? And that was another thing that we wanted to bring in, you know? So, you know, there was just a lot there. ",
,MC," Yeah, and you did that for a year? ",
,EC," I did that for a year and then got into my master's program. My master's program was a very good program because it was called the community-based block, so we were required to do community work and I volunteered in counseling in immigration. So I did some immigration counseling and, uh, it was, uh, half women half men. One third Latinos, chicanos, one third white, and one third black. So, we dealt with psychological issues dealing with people from other cultures. So, when we studied psychological theory, we wanted to also apply psychological theory that was being presented, you know, from the perspective of a Latino, from the perspective of an African American. You know, or a woman, or a Native American, you know? ",
,MC, So it was multicultural? ,
,EC," It was a multicultural program. So it just built on what I had already done and prepared me, you know, in ways that, you know, I'm really glad I was there 'cause it just gave me such a-- ",
,MC," Well, and it's a great example of the, you know, you were talking earlier about Third-Worldist or Marxist, Leninist, understandings of oppression versus nationalist understandings of oppression and it seems like that's a good example of stepping outside of your nationalist frame, you know, to try to understand. ",
,EC," Mhmm. And then I finished the program, uh, I think in August, and in June or July I had already been offered a contract by the Sweetwater School District. Before I even got my degree. ",
,MC, And that's here in uh-- ,
,EC," Yeah, right here in Chula Vista, in Sweetwater. And part of the reason was that they had no bilingual counselors. Uh, a lot of the counselors that were out there were Anglo counselors. They did not know how to speak Spanish, and they were having to deal with families and fathers like my own father that didn't want to let their daughters go to college. And, um, and they didn't know how to deal with it. Not only could they not talk to them, uh, to the families, they couldn't even, you know, understand some of the issues that, you know, some of the, um, minority kids were going through; or underrepresented. And, so, they hired me before I even got my degree and I started with them in '74 and retired about three years ago. So, I put in about 32 years. ",
,MC, With the same district? ,
,EC, With the same district. ,
,MC, Wow. ,
,EC," With the same district. And I started as a Title 1 Counselor and I did groups with Latino families in a middle school. Actually, three middle schools 'cause I was a district counselor. ",
,MC," So, what does a Title 1 Counselor do? What does ""Title 1” mean? ",
,EC," The Title 1 is for underrepresented students, students that are performing at least three years behind their grade level. So, they might be eighth graders but their reading and writing skills are at about the fifth, sixth grade level. So, you're trying to build their self-esteem, their family self-esteem, so that they can perform at a higher level. And, so, I did a lot of groups. Not only with students but I did groups with, um, the mothers, the fathers, the families, and from there I was hired at Sweetwater High School and I worked there for, um, what, 17 years? That was my longest stay.",
,MC," How many latinos did you have in that-- at, uh, Sweetwater High School?",
,EC," Uh, the majority. ",
,MC," Oh, so there wasa majority presence. ",
,EC," Oh, yeah, it was like 80%. ",
,MC, Which is why they hired you. ,
,EC," Yeah. When I started at that school, 10% of the kids were going to college. When I left that school. 90% were going to college. ",
,MC, Congratulations.,
,EC," I set up a scholarship program for them, we-- through MEChA we had scholarships. And I'm not talking about 100 dollars. I'm talking about 500 to 1,000 to 2,000 dollar scholarships. Uh, they were going to major universities"," Stanford, Harvard, Yale, you know? UCLA, USC. So we did real well. Then, from there, the district was gonna open a new school in Eastlake and I had gotten really involved with the College Board. I was on the board for the SAT, for the College Board, attended many conferences with them and did many workshops. I did workshops with a woman, Kati Haycock on working with counselors throughout the nation and she finally ended up going to Washington D.C. and working for the Children's Defense Fund. And heading that. Um, but did workshops with them, um, for counselors all over the place I was doing workshops on how to reach latino families and help latino children get into college and how to work with them. And I did a lot of extensive work with them and sat on their board for many years, and, so I had that connection. Plus, I did SAT and ACT testings on the weekends to try and get more kids to go to college. 'Cause you can't get 'em to go to college if they don't take their SAT, right? So, and PSAT and PLAN IT and all those. You know, so I ran all those programs. And, so, they were gonna open a new school in Eastlake and they asked me if I would go to that school. They hired the principal, I was the second person to be hired, and I wrote all the curriculum for that school and set up all the codes and did everything that needed to be done so that they could become accredited and legitimate. And, uh, I stayed there for ten years, did very well, set up a pretty, very good program, a well-known program, I was there for ten years. "
,MC, And that was also a Latino school? ,
,EC," No, that was not quite all latino. It was probably, uh, maybe 40% Latino and 20% Filipino and a small group of African Americans and whites. It was upper mobility. It was quite a bit different than, um, Sweetwater. Sweetwater, I would say, a good 70%, 70-80% were on the free lunch program. Whereas at Eastlake it was, uh, maybe 30%. ",
,MC," So, a little bit more diverse in terms of the student population, socio-economic level, um, and you said you developed a curriculum? ",
,EC," I developed their AP curriculum, their honors program, I was the head counselor and the scholarship counselor, the MEChA advisor, and I ran the folklórico program and I don't know how to dance folklórico. I put them together and we got the kids to teach each other and finally they decided, hey, you know this is a legitimate program and they hired a teacher in PE and they got folklórico and then I started the Mariachi Program there, too. So, I mean, you know, those were the things that I was doing, you know? I was part of MEChA, I wanted to build the kids-- and one of the interesting things in MEChA, and this is, I think, what I brought with me"," we had, in our mesa-- the way I ran MEChA, is we had a mesa directiva. We didn't have a president, okay? And there was 10 kids that were the mesa directiva. And each kid ran one meeting and they were responsible for setting up the agenda and making sure everything was gonna run smoothly. They ran the meeting, okay? And everybody had equal power in the mesa directiva, and nothing would go to MEChA unless there was majority. And in mesa directiva, the last-- it was all chicano kids, you know? And we would do MEChA conferences and we would have a MEChA conference one a year hosted by one of the schools in our district. We had a latina conference, the latina conferences we had for the young women, latino conferences for the young men, and then the MEChA conferences. So, we had several conferences. And then we had the, the MEChA conference at San Diego State and the MEChA conference at UCSD that we would take the kids to, so we had a lot of stuff. We'd do college trips, muchas cosas. And, um, and of course, and to make sure that we had Mexican-American Studies on our campus. "
,MC, At the high school level?,
,EC, At the high school level. ,
,MC," So, you had Mexican-American Studies?",
,EC," Oh, yes.",
,MC," And did you develop that curriculum? I mean, in the sense of, you were responsible for AP and honors, was--? ",
,EC," No, not necessarily, because we did have that many classes, you know, we had one or two classes, you know, that the kids took. But, what I wanted to say is that, um, MEChA became such a large group on campus. It was one of the biggest-- even at Eastlake. We would have 150 kids at our meetings. ",
,MC, Wow. ,
,EC," I mean, I-- we would have a Cinco de Mayo celebration where we would have señoritas, and I wasn't into the beauty queen thing or anything like that, you know, but we did it to raise money and we would raise five to ten thousand dollars. In one dance. Charging two, three dollars at the door. Uh, the girls would sell tickets for one dollar and that's how you got into the dance. The girl who sold the most tickets was the one that won. And it wasn't necessarily the prettiest girl. ",
,MC, Wow I love that. ,
,EC," And we brought in the families, they were escorted by their fathers, and presented with their families, and another thing that I did, too. It was-- oh God, what did we call it? It was like a-- it was for young girls. It was like a coming out party, like a dieciseis, like quinces, like having a quince, but it was at 16. There was this lady who had owned a bridal shop and she had all these gowns and she didn't know what to do with them. So, she decided to start this program, and, um, they invited me and they said, ""Do you want to be a part of it."" And, of course, I was working with girls. So I said, ""Sure!"" And we would have the girls go through a series of classes, you know, to learn about themselves, to learn about their status in society, to learn about, you know, how to dress appropriately, you know, we even had a hat and a tea party for them. We did, you know, little things to show them how to set a table, how to walk into a room, things like that, you know? And then we would have a debutante ball for them. And we would rent a big hotel and it didn't cost the girls anything. We would raise all the money, we had all the gowns already, and rather than having the families go through the expense of having the quinceañera, we would have a big ball. And they could invite so many people.",
,MC," A cotillion ball, or something like that. ",
,EC," Yes, and we would have, you know, 10, 15 girls presented every year and we that four or five years. ",
,MC, I think that's wonderful. ,
,EC," It was. I mean, it turned out really, really nice. ",
,TAPE 2C,,
,MC," But, you know, this is what's interesting to me, right, so some feminists would say, ""Well, you know, you're doing this presenting and this cotillion and this and that and,"" you know, I'm just-- what would your answer-- what does it do for them, um, in their mentalities, that experience? ",
,EC," I would tell these women that they're full of shit and that they don't know what they're talking about. Because if a young chicana or a young African American woman wants to make it in this society, they better as hell know how to enter a room and shake a hand, and sit at a formal table, and eat correctly. And if they can't do that, they're not gonna get any points. You know-- ",
,MC," But also, like, a kind of self-esteem. ",
,EC," Oh, yes. ",
,MC, I think that with the cotillion-- there is an African American tradition of the cotillion and there's the sweet 16-- ,
,EC, And also in the Latino community. ,
,MC, And the quince in the Latino community. ,
,EC, Yes. ,
,MC, But not everybody can afford to do that. ,
,EC," Exactly. And that's why we did this program. Because I knew that some of the families were not going to be able to afford this. But, what was more important wasn't the ball. What was more important were those classes, and if they didn't attend those classes, they weren't gonna go to the ball and wear that gown, you know? That had to mean something. You know, it's like rites of passage. But, anyway, what I wanted to say about MEChA-- that was just a side track-- and I can't think about, oh, gosh, what did we call that? Era un nombre mexicano. For the debutant, but I can't remember. ",
,"So, one of the things that was really interesting was how the students in MEChA evolved. Because they also went through-- they had to, you know, go through this nationalistic thing and, you know, ""I'm chicano and I speak Spanish and mariachi and folklórico,"" and you know, all this stuff. But to get them to the next level, you know, these are things that are in other cultures, you know? These are things that we have in similarity. So, what was really interesting and to me I think one of my biggest accomplishments that I felt working with MEChA is that they accepted other people coming into our mesa directiva. And they wanted to be part of our group. 'Cause some of the girls were going out with, you know, Anglo guys, and some of the guys were going out with African American girls, and so we started having, in our mesa directiva, Filipinos, African Americans, and Anglo. And since we were one of the largest and most visible clubs on campus, you know, 'cause we had so many activities, and we were very consistent with our meetings, and everything was run by the students, it wasn't run by me. You know, or, you know, 'cause I always had co-advisors. I always had people that wanted to work with me, you know, they'd say, ""Well, can I help you with MEChA?"" And usually there were three or four of us and they wanted to be part of this organization. ",,
,"And the other thing is, that caused a lot of ruckus in our district but eventually, you know, we had board support, is that when students in MEChA-- because they had to do community service, too. They had to go out and do community projects and volunteer, or do other activities, you know? Because as a club we did some activities and, you know, as individuals they did activities. And, so, um I wanted the kids to be recognized, when they graduated, as being a MeChista. And, so, we had set up sashes, okay? And, so, if you were in the club for-- because you had to pay very little, it was like ten bucks or something like that to belong to the club and fill out the application and go through an interview, and you know, just do different things. But all that was a process of preparing them for a job or preparing them for something else. And, um, so once they got into the club and they attended so many meetings and did so many hours of community service-- and mesa directiva was the one that was kinda keeping tabs on all this. And they each had, each mesa member had ten members that they had to be in contact with. You know, letting them know what was going on and meetings and activities and so forth. So, they had other duties, too, you know? And when we would do fundraisers or whatever, community services, they would each volunteer for different things. ",,
,"And, so, um what was really neat was to see them be accepting of other people from different ethnic backgrounds, actually join the mesa part. Not necessarily as members, 'cause we had members, but being part of that decision-making group. And, you know, after about two or three years, 'cause I did MEChA at Eastlake for about ten years, after about the third year we started having different people coming in. And it just made us better. You know, and they saw that. It was really neat. And then, after that, I moved to San Ysidro 'cause they were gonna open another school. And in San Ysidro, that was 90% mexicanos, I mean, because it was right next to the border. 90% free lunch, you know? And I did MEChA there too. I was, uh, also the second person hired, opened up the school, wrote the curriculum, did all the same things that I had done over at the other school, and they knew that I had done it there, so that's why they asked me to go to the other school to open it up. And, uh, and usually, you know, when you open a school the first year, you're in an office, basically doing all the paperwork and getting everything ready for accreditation and all that stuff. And it's not until the second year that you're there that you actually start, you know, with students and you usually start with two grades, you know, like with ninth and tenth and then you add one grade every year after that and so forth. ",,
,"So, I was there for five years, head counselor, scholarship counselor, MEChA advisor, um, I had a latino principal there that was fantastic, so in terms of a mariachi and folklórico program that was already gonna be there, you know? And I had already built a reputation in our district and they already had mariachi programs throughout the schools and when I was at Eastlake it was just beginning, the folklórico and the mariachi. So, it was a little harder there. You know, the band teacher hated me because I wanted mariachi, but you know. Anyway, so I was there for five years, and again, same thing. I built up the MEChA program, um, by the last year or so a little more diversity in the mesa and really had really good time just working with the kids and seeing their development, you know, kinda going through what I went through when I first went to college but they were doing it in high school. And that was kind of really neat to see them getting to know who they were as women, you know, or getting to know who they were as men, you know? And they weren't-- they didn't need to be these cholo guys, you know? And it was really neat to see that. And to see them apply to a university and get accepted and then you know, six years down the line, ten years down the line, you know, they're getting their law degrees or medical degrees or they're engineers or they're lawyers or whatever they are, you know? But, having successful lives and not having to live day by day, you know? Social security or, you know, eat only when they come to school, that kind of stuff, you know? ",,
,,,
,,,
,MC," Well, I mean, that's what I wanted to ask you because it seems like your career as a counselor and as someone involved with youth seems like is really influenced by what you learned from the movement. ",
,,,
,,,
,EC," Oh, yeah, everything. ",
,MC," I just, you know, I don't know if you want to add to that at all, but what did you learn as a person in college, right, and thereafter who was in the Chicano Movement, a chicana, how did your career as an educator and a counselor reflect that? What values--? ",
,EC," Yeah, well I think my college experience empowered me to be me and not have to, you know, be anything else and to speak up, and to say what I feel. And to this day, you know, I say what I feel and what I think, and some people don't like it. You know, I'm not gonna, I'm not a put-on, you know, and I never have been. And I don't kiss butt. You know, and I say it how I see it, you know? To me it's important to be human, you know, and treat other people like I want to be treated. ",
,MC," And what do you, you mentioned at the end that you felt like these are high school kids that you're exposing to the same kinds of feelings and pedagogies that you were exposed to in college, you know, which kind of gets them on the roller a little bit faster, I guess. What is at the core of that, do you think? I mean, self-esteem, or understanding their histories? ",
,EC," Oh, yes, all that is very important. Self confidence, being able to get up in front of a group and speak and not be afraid. And that's what it was so important for those kids to run those meetings. ""Oh, I can't do it I can't do it!"" ""Oh, yes you can."" I said, ""You write down what you're gonna say and if you need to practice come in my office and we'll practice."" I said, ""But you're running the meeting. I’m not running the meeting. I'm not even coming in until half-way through 'cause I've got something else to do. You are running the meeting. You are going to control what's going on in that room."" And it was scary for them, you know, a high school student to do that with 100 kids (laughs). But I would tell the other mesas, ""Don't sit with your friends. You need to separate yourselves around."" You know, ""So that you can help control, too."" ",
,MC, And those are the skills that you really didn't -- ,
,EC," And the think is, also, you know, you-- I never-- even with parents, I never like having meetings that-- I never like having meetings that had no purpose. You know, that because it's, you know, Title 1 says you have to have twelve meetings a year or whatever, you know? And so you're gonna have a meeting and you're just gonna cover whatever? Uh uh. I felt that, I always felt that if you're gonna have a meeting it's because you're gonna give people information they can use to become a better person, you know, and empower them. And same thing with the students. If you're gonna have a MEChA meeting, just to have a MEChA meeting, para qué? Let's just not have one. ",
,MC, Yeah. I hate meetings. ,
,EC, Yeah. I like meetings when they're interesting. ,
,MC, Right. ,
,EC," And you're gonna learn something and you're gonna take something from them. So I always had speakers. I would have, like Chunky came one time and he played his music and talked about the history of the music. I would have professors of Chicano Studies at San Diego State come in and do like a thirty minute presentation, because we didn't have very much. It was a lunch meeting. And sometimes we would have meetings after school because we wanted more time with each other to do what we needed to do, you know, so we had a speaker that we wanted to listen to longer, you know? I remember having women come in a speak to the whole group, you know, about women's issues, because they guys needed to hear it, too, you know? So it was just-- you know, I'd have people that had been in the Vietnam War come in and talk about their experience in that, so, you know, it wasn't just about me or about what was going on in school, but giving them information about, ""Hey, what's going on out there?"" You know, what are some of the issues, you know, and if they head about an issue on TV and wanted to know more about it, ""Okay, let's call. Let's call the mayor and invite him to come in."" I mean, and we had publishers come in, um, and of course with Gus working at San Diego State at the time, 'cause he was the director of EOP and he was in charge of ethnic studies, you know, he would come in contact with a lot of people that he was gonna have speaking at the university. And he says, ""You want them to come down and speak with your kids?"" ""Sure!"" ",
,"You know, so I had, you know, uh, directors of movies, uh, actores, I think we had James Olmos come in and speak on time. I mean, so we had good speakers and sometimes because the speakers were gonna take time, they would allow me to keep them extra, you know, 'cause they knew-- and then I would open it up to anybody that wanted to come and, you know, so MEChA was doing these kinds of things. And, so, you know, other people wanted to be part of it, you know? And they would bring their class, ""Can I bring my class?"" You know, and, so, and it was exciting. It was exciting because it wasn't boring, you know, you were actually gonna be learning something, you know? So I was always trying to do things like that that they were contemporary and they were gonna keep the kids engaged and excited, you know? And, you know, it worked. ",,
,"So, my last four years I worked at the district. They moved me to the district and I was in charge of all the counselors in the district. We had about 250, 300 counselors and I did their inservice and I did, um, basically what I was doing for the MEChA kids I was doing for counselors now. And, you know, providing them with the tools they needed to be more effective counselors and reach more families. And then I retired. So that was a lot (laughs). ",,
,MC," Well, can I ask two follow-up questions? Do I have time? I have nine minutes? Is that enough? I think so. Is that okay? ",
,EC,  Yeah. ,
,MC," Okay. So, um, this isn't exactly a segway, but it is a little bit. You said that in 1970, right after you had gotten married, you went to Crystal City. ",
,EC," Yes. I was there for a summer. Six weeks, I believe, doing work with the Raza Unida Party. ",
,MC," What drew you there? How did you get pulled into that, and what were you doing there? ",
,EC," Well, I had taken a Chicano Studies class with René Nuñez and he said that he was going to be taking a group of students down there and who wanted to go and I volunteered and I wanted to learn more about la Raza Unida Party. And I was all into it. We walked precincts and met with board members and it was hot and going at that time over there. I mean, there was a lot of stuff happening and it opened my eyes to a lot of things. I think they were ahead of themselves, at least by ten to fifteen years, in terms of what was going on in the educational system. Um, and in politics, you know, and representation for latinos. So, it was really exciting and I got to walk the streets and campaign and see, you know, campaigns born and elected. ",
,MC," And did you, um, so were you there to look at the political party or were you there to look at the educational transformations? ",
,EC," Both. 'Cause I was really interested in bilingual education as well, you know, what was going on in terms of the education of students. So I took advantage of doing both of them. ",
,MC, But you were married. ,
,EC," Yeah, I was married. ",
,MC, And did your husband come with you? ,
,EC, No. ,
,MC," How did he feel? Um, how long after this was the three day walkout? ",
,EC, (Laughs) No that was early in our marriage. And we got married in '69. ,
,MC, Okay so this is a year after your three-day walkout. ,
,EC," Yeah, oh yeah, and he knew that I was really involved and committed to what I was doing, so, you know, he supported me. ",
,MC, Six weeks is a long time. ,
,EC," Yeah, also with CHE, was a lot of commitment, too, you know? And he supported me. He was working, I was going to school and doing all this stuff, so. You know, I didn't have a baby at that time, but--. ",
,MC," And the other question I wanted to ask you is about the Houston conference because this conference has been written about now, so now it's become kind of this touchstone, um, and this is the first National Chicana Conference in Houston, Texas. And I was just wondering, first, how you found out about it. Second, how you got there, because that was quite a logistical undertaking, I'm sure. It was not with a class so I'm sure it was a little bit different. And, third, what was your experience at that conference? ",
,EC," Well, the conference was, uh, we found out about it through the networking that we had with the women in LA and the Bay Area and when we found out about it, you know, of course we wanted to go. And, uh, somehow we managed to get enough money to rent one of those big, long busses, and I think about fifteen of us went in one of those big busses. And I think a couple other people went in a couple cars. It was a pretty good group from San Diego. I'd say probably about twenty of us. And, um, I don't remember too much. I think some of us might have even slept in the van and, uh, at the conference I remember there were a lot of women, a lot of white women. ",
,MC, White women? At the national conference? At the Women's National Conference or the chicana one?,
,MC," The chicana one. Wait, you went to the Women's conference? ",
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC, Oh my gosh. ,
,EC," The National Women's Conference. And that conference, I don't know why but I remember all these white women with big hats. ",
,MC," Okay. Wait a minute. I didn't know you went to this. So, do you have to-- are you in a hurry? Or can you talk about that for a little bit? ",
,EC, It was weird. ,
,[TAPE CHANGE],,
,MC," So, you were just telling me about '71 and renting a van to go to-- ",
,EC," Okay, which one? ",
,MC," Both. '71 is the National Chicana Conference. And I know there was a regional conference in California to prepare for the National Conference and that was in, I think, Los Angeles. ",
,EC, It was in LA. ,
,MC," Did you go to that, too? ",
,EC, Yes. ,
,MC, Do you remember anything about that process? ,
,EC," You know what, that conference I don't remember too much. Um, other than you know we were dealing with women's issues, basically. ",
,MC, And did you have a baby by then? '71? ,
,EC, No. I had my baby in '74. ,
,MC," Oh, okay so then you had the flexibility and you were still in school. ",
,EC, Yes. ,
,MC," And, so, you said-- did you go with a group of chicanos from San Diego to Houston to the '71 conference? ",
,EC," Yes, we rented a van and, uh, we went to the conference and attended workshops-- ",
,MC," It wasn't the first time you had been out of the state, right? 'Cause you had been to Texas? ",
,EC," No, I had already-- and to the, uh, Denver Youth Conference, yeah. So we had done several conferences. ",
,MC," And, do you have any memories of the '71 National Chicana Conference? ",
,EC," Um, I remember us walking out, uh, and there was some disagreement-- do you know what, I can't even remember what the disagreement was about. But I remember that Felicitas went and Silvia Romero Chiva, uh, Vivian went to that conference. I'm trying to think who else went. Um, it was the main core group. I'm not sure if Maria Sanchez went or the Rascón girls, but, uh, there was about fifteen of us and there were women from the Bay Area and women from LA and then us from San Diego, and then there were women from Texas, and, the women from Texas were real tapadas. They were. They weren't where the California women were. And they-- why are you laughing (Laughs)? ",
,MC," Well, I'll tell you, here's the thing"," we've talked to different women who have attended this conference and, um-- "
,EC," They thought we were radical, huh? ",
,MC," So, you know, what we've heard from other women is that there remain some main issues that people had disagreements over. One was, who was running the conference, that it was at the YWCA, um, the other was the food, hot dogs. There was some problem with the hot dogs. It wasn't chicano food. And that it wasn't in the chicano-- it was in a chicano barrio but that there weren't enough barrio women being represented. ",
,EC, Uh huh. ,
,MC," But the other thing that came out in some of the interviews was the suspicion that the nationalist chicanas from LA had been sent as disruptors. I don't know if you remember anything about this or some of the tensions that arose, or why or that?",
,EC," I just remember a lot of chaos and, uh, people disagreeing with each other and us leaving. You know, and I didn't really participate much and I don't think we were there that long either. And I think it did have to do with control. Who had control in the logistics. Like, it was, you know, something that somebody higher up was doing for their own purpose kind of thing, so. ",
,MC, Something you said that was very interesting was these regional differences also kind of seemed to play out. Like you had a certain impression of the Texas women. ,
,EC," Oh, gosh. ",
,MC, Tell me!,
,EC," The Texas women were so tapadas at that time and not so much more now, but, and the women from New Mexico eran españolas. You know? ""Nosotras somos españolas, no somos mexicanas."" You know, so there were differences, you know, and you just noticed it,  you know? And when you took the time to go to a conference, anyway, I did, when I took time to go to a conference I took time so that I could learn. And I could be, you know, empowered with information that I could bring back to, you know, to implement, to put into practice, you know? And this conference was a real dud and I think that we kind of felt like, ""What are we doing here? Let's just go back."" ",
,MC," And, I guess, taking away from it, because a lot of people put different significance on that conference, like it was almost like this one opportunity for chicanas to do sort of like what MEChA had done which was to consolidate a national movement. And, so, what did you, I mean, did you feel, coming out of that, I mean, it probably didn't register that much on you. It sounds like it didn't. ",
,EC," Yeah, the energy wasn't there. You know, and the speakers weren't there and it was like something that was set up that you were gonna run. You know, and it was like, it's like going to a class and listening to a lecture and you heard that lecture two years ago. You know, and so you feel like, what am I doing here, you know, I'm in the wrong place, you know, kind of thing. So it was evident that, you know, uh, it was for women that were at a different place, and we were not there. We were somewhere else already. We had already been there. ",
,MC," And do you feel like, um, so there's a number of conferences at this time that are also national conferences, beginning with the Denver Youth Conference. Which it sound like, at that time, the Denver Youth Conference was-- ",
,EC," Oh, yeah, the energy there was-- ",
,MC, Huge. ,
,EC," Oh, yeah. You had Corky Gonzales, the Raza Unida Party, José Ángel Gutiérrez was there. Men, of course. José Tijerina from the land grant movement, uh, Jesus, everybody. Alurista was doing poetry. You know, really heavy interest poetry.",
,MC, He was from San Diego. ,
,EC," Oh, yeah. He was with our group. And then, uh, so there was some very high powered chicanos that were leaders of the Chicano Movement, you know, we still didn't have any women, you know, uh the women were gonna be coming after that, you know, with Dolores Huerta and some of the other women that came forth after that. ",
,MC," And you also talk a little bit about this other conference from 1977 which was a total surprise when you mentioned that. I didn't realize that you had gone to this-- Houston in 1977. Now, the Houston Conference comes after the big International Women's Year Conference in 1975, right, in Mexico City, where a bunch of chicanas went to that. Chicanas from San Diego, too, I believe. I don't know if you know any of the women who went there? ",
,EC," Yes, I do.",
,MC," Oh, really? Who?",
,EC," Uh, Lilia López went, I believe, and she was involved with Comisión Femenil here in San Diego. ",
,MC," Oh, yeah, we haven’t even talked to her. ",
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC," Sorry, I lied about only asking you a few questions. ",
,MC," Yeah, and, um, I think Gracia went to that. ",
,Linda," Yeah, she did. ",
,EC," Um, I don’t know if any of our little core group, Felicitas or— I don’t think they went. I think it was more, uh, DF women (laughs). You know what DF means, right? ",
,MC," Oh, yeah, Distrito Federal. ",
,EC, Yeah. ,
,Linda," That part of town, yeah. ",
,EC," Yeah, okay, so for some reason, no. And that was in ’75? Yeah. And I had just had my baby, so. But I remember going to the Houston Conference, the Women’s Conference. ",
,Linda, Did you got to the state meeting in San Jose? The California state meeting?,
,MC," So, there was, in Houston— ",
,Linda, Where they elected the delegates for Houston. Did you got to that meeting?,
,EC, I don’t think so. ,
,Linda, ‘Cause actually there were two I think…,
,MC, There were state meetings in every state where chicanas met— ,
,Linda, Well—,
,MC, Not every state. ,
,Linda," Right. No, there were state meetings and women met to— ",
,EC," I remember going to this conference in Houston and I remember a group of us, it was the same group that went to the Chicanas Conference, and walking into this room, in this gymnasium, I think it was a gymnasium— ",
,Linda, It was the Houston Conference then. It was a huge room. ,
,EC," Yeah, it was a huge room with a platform and I kinda have a feeling that they we’re gonna have Hillary Clinton or somebody like that speak, I don’t know. Gloria Steinem and all these people. And I walk in and I see these women with these hats and I’m going, “Oh, hell, where am I?” You know (laughs)? ",
,MC, Why did you go to that conference?,
,EC," I don’t know, because I was invited or a group of us wanted us to go, or, we were asked or I don’t know. I was there and I remember they wouldn’t let us talk every time we tried to talk, um, they would shut us up and they were really rude to us, and, so, we said, “You know what? We’re outta here. We’re gonna have our own conference.” And then we ended up finding another place and had our own meeting. ",
,MC," And, do you remember meeting other chicanas there? ",
,EC, Mhmm. ,
,MC," And, any names or anything",
,EC," Yeah. Anna Nieto I think was there and Maggie and Corrine Sanchez was there. Yeah, because I also went to Washington, D.C. As part of MEChA, um, they wanted a group to meet with Richardson, who was in charge of Health and Education at that time. He was, uh, what do you call ‘em? Director or—?",
,MC, HEW? Was he one of the HEW mediators? ,
,EC," He was a director. He was— the president had just assigned him to head this department or, you know, the bureau of whatever. And, and they had, somehow, MEChA was asked to send a delegate to meet with him and I was one of the delegates that was selected and they paid for my trip and everything. And, so, I got to meet with him and there was a group. And I’m not sure if it was connected with MEChA and the Chicano Federation or what but somehow I ended up in Washington, D.C. and met with this gentleman and this is where I met— ",
,MC, Elliot Richardson. ,
,EC," Elliot Richardson, yes. ",
,MC, We found him on Wikipedia (laughs).,
,EC," Yes, and he was head of what?",
,MC, HEW. ,
,END OF TAPE 3,,
,EC," HEW, yeah. Health Education and Welfare. Yeah. And since I was involved with health and chicanos and all that, they wanted me to go and talk to him about it. And, so, I went as a representative and met with him and it was a few others of us that went. I think there were four other people. And at that time I met Maggie, ‘cause they were already there with, um, Sy Abrego. Uh, oh God, and Monte Perez. ",
,MC, Monte Perez?,
,EC," Uh, they were in Washington, D.C. They were heading up another agency that was a chicano agency. And Corrine and Maggie— ",
,MC, Maggie? Cuál Maggie? ,
,EC, Maggie Carrillo. [Tape 3a 0,"54] Okay? And it was Monte Perez and Sy Abrego and I can’t remember. And it was, oh God, something to do with Hispanics or something. And, so, I met them and we really hit it off really good. So, I left after that meeting and they invited me to come back and spend a month with them. And they ran an agency and it was a chicano agency. Lookup Monte Perez. See what you can find. And it’s, um, gosh. Gus would remember what the name of that agency is. And, so, I mean, I just fell in love with the girls, you know, and we just, uh, they were just so—! "
,MC, So it was Maggie— ,
,EC, It was Maggie and Corrine Sanchez. ,
,MC," So, they were there at the Washington meeting. ",
,EC," They were in Washington, D.C. at the time and that’s when I met them and they had— they were working for an agency with Monte Perez and Sy Abrego, I think it was. ",
,MC," I know this, because we need to interview Corinne. ",
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC, She said she would. It’s just that we have to get to L.A. ,
,EC," Uh huh, and, so, and so that’s how I met them and we clicked, I mean, they were so progressive and it was just so interesting to sit and talk with them, and, uh, so when they came back to L.A. it was like, “Wow,” you know? “This is cool.” But I think they were in L.A. first and then they went over there, and they were there for ten years or so and then came back. ",
,MC, That’s right. Corrine was involved in the organizing with Anna Nieto early on. ,
,EC, Yeah. ,
,MC," With Hijas, yeah. And if you went during Elliot Richardson’s tenure, that would have been between ’70 and ’73. So that’s around the time that it would have happened. ",
,EC," Yeah, so I did that, too. ",
,MC, I wonder what they were doing. It wasn’t NCLR? It wasn’t National Council for La Raza?,
,EC, Yes! ,
,MC," That’s what I thought, because she was an NCLR lawyer. ",
,EC," Yeah, National Council for La Raza, yeah, yes. And they were really involved with a lot of stuff there. ",
,MC," The Office of Hispanic Affairs in the White House, and— ",
,LINDA, That was Rosemary. ,
,MC," That was Rosemary Roybal who we also interviewed, um, yeah, so that— ",
,EC," So that put me in contact with all the, that little group of women that were there in Washington, D.C. at that time, which— ",
,MC," Well, and so was Cecilia Burciaga who recently passed away, unfortunately. I think she was there at that time. And Lupe Anguiano.",
,LINDA, Right. ,
,EC," So, it was just a matter of coincidence that I got to go different places, and, I mean, I’ve been really lucky that I’ve been able to— not only in the United States, but you know even in my work I was selected by Eastlake, um, we had a Japanese school so they sent me to Japan for fifteen days, expense paid trip and they gave me a $500 stipend. And I learned a little bit of Japanese, visited schools to compare, you know, their system with our system, and, I mean, I was really lucky then. I got to go, I was selected by San Ysidro to go to China and I was able to go to China for, what was it? Another fifteen days or so. And then took a group of students to go to Europe and we started in Amsterdam, Holland, and went all the way through Austria and Germany, um, the Black Forest and went to Venice and Paris and all those places and then took that underwater train and ended in Scotland and came back home. And that was like, about a two and a half week trip. ",
,MC," That’s a big— you know, for a girl from Calexico. ",
,EC," I know it! You know, to do all this stuff, I mean, I was— you know, to travel all of Europe, you know, it was kind of neat to go to Japan and China which are so different from our culture, you know, very different, and learn a little bit about their culture and their language and speak a few words, you know? Um, I’ve been lucky. I’ve been lucky. I’ve just been in the right places at the right time and have had, you know, the ability to have experiences, you know, that that have made me a better person. ",
,MC," Well, you know, this gives me the opportunity to finish up, to do what I’m supposed to do every time, which is to ask you a kind of summary question. And, um, that is, well, there’s two. One is, how would describe your political profile today? Um, are you still active in community and social movements? And what kinds of political activities are most meaningful to you and why?",
,EC," I'll start with the last one. To me it’s important that people are treated with respect and, um, especially women, you know? Um, and, you know, I’m very open about, you know, um, when I see injustice I speak up. Um, so women and I have a son who’s gay, and, so, I let my family know, I let— everybody knows. I’m very proud of him. I love him. And those kinds of issues are important to me, you know, and I try to stay up to date as much as I can, uh, reading, by reading or watching programs. I’m a news addict. I’m always watching CNN (laughs). When something’s happening in the world I’m right there. I want to see what opinions people have. I love Rachel Maddow (laughs). I love watching her show. ",
,MC," So, you’re not a conservative. ",
,EC," Oh, no. No. And it’s not being a conservative so much as having an open mind. You know, because I can be conservative on some things, you know? I like culture and I like tradition and there’s certain things that, you know, I think have their place. But, um, not necessarily, you know, real liberal or real conservative or whatever. I just like having an open mind. I’m not religious, um, I was raised Catholic, uh, but when I came to college I did not like what The Church was saying about women, and, so, I do not believe in religion because I don’t like the way they treat women. And, so, I don’t belong to any kind of religion. Um, I didn’t raise my kids with any religion. We do go to powwows. My husband is part Chickasaw and I am part Yaqui. So, I believe in Mother Earth and respecting Mother Earth and, uh, and to me that’s my religion, you know? And I think religion blinds people into not seeing, uh, the real world, you know, but that’s another one. ",
,"And I came to that consciousness when I came to college. So, you know, my philosophy is, you know, just keep an open mind and treat people with respect and how you want to be treated. Um, being involved in political movements, I’m not too involved in a whole lot of stuff, but I do— when I come across people and I see something that’s not right, I tell them. I don’t have a problem with it. Um, like I said before, I’m not a kiss ass. I’m gonna tell you what’s on my mind and if you don’t like it, “Adios! We’ll see you later.” (Laughs) So, and, I do sit on a couple of boards, you know, still promoting underrepresented students going to college. Um, but even my philosophy for that has changed quite a bit. Especially now with the way, um, the system is putting kids in debt. You know, most kids that are graduating from college are coming out with 30, 40, 50 thousand dollar loans. How much loan do you have? 40? ",,
,MC, She just started.,
,Student, I’m not completely sure. We haven’t filled it out. ,
,EC," You’re gonna be a freshman? Okay, so you’re just starting. ",
,MC," Yeah, she’s going to Iowa state. ",
,Linda, Iowa State is a very good value for the money. ,
,EC," Okay, well, my daughter when to Berkeley, okay, and, um, she had a little bit of debt but we got rid of it, most of it. My son went to Chico State, my next one. So that wasn’t so bad. My third son went to UC Santa Cruz and I’m still paying on that one, ‘cause I didn’t let them— you know, I wanted them to concentrate on their studies. And my youngest son who’s 24, went to UC Santa Barbara and that one was big. He got some loans, but, um, I mean, some scholarships, because he played soccer and he was a good student, uh, but, um, we ended up paying for quite a bit. But, so, anyway, with students nowadays going to college, they’re ending up with anywhere from 40,000 dollars to 120,000 dollar loans. The government just decided yesterday to lower the rate back to a lower rate, but the rate is gonna increase by the market. So if the market goes up, the rate is gonna go up. And what’s happening now is kids are going to college, whether— and I’m not talking about community college. I’m talking about universities and state colleges. They’re coming out with a debt that’s like a mortgage and they’re not getting the jobs. And, so, it’s putting a lot of pressure on the youth that they have to come out and they’re taking whatever job they can to be able to start paying those loans back. They have a loan before they even get started, and I can’t agree with that. I think that’s wrong. Even the low-income students, they’re not even qualifying for that much Cal Grant or Pell Grant because the income level that they have is like 30,000 dollars for a family of four. Come on! Give me a break! So I really think that we have to rethink the whole thing. And I don’t have a problem with kids going to college, but I do have a problem with the debt they’re being incurred before they even get started with their lives, and I don’t think that’s fair. And, so, even that part I’m re-thinking. I do want them to go to college because I think college provides you with an experience you’re not gonna gain anywhere else and going to work is not gonna do it and you do have to have a profession and a career and something to do, you know? Something that you love with a passion that you’re not doing just for the money. You can’t do that if you don’t have a college degree, ‘cause the college degree shows you what you love with a passion. And when you go to work right out of high school or when you go to work without completing a degree, you end up with a job that you probably hate. You know, so, I think college does that for kids more than anything else. Of course, it gives you a paper, you know, but it gives you that insight to know, what is it that I want to do that I really love and, you know, that I can pour myself into and enjoy and survive. So, you know, so that’s why I’m involved with this organization, Wahupa, on the board. I’m their vice-president right now. ",
,MC, And Wahupa does what? ,
,EC," It’s a program for the county— they’re all the way north-south. Uh, upward bound, and a program for adults that encourages adults to go back and get their GED and go to college, so, I’m still involved with that.",
,MC," Well, thank you very much. ",
,EC, You’re welcome.,
