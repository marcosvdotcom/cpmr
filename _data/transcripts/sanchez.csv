,I," Well, thank you, Rita Sanchez, for being with us and sharing your story with Chicana Por Mi Raza. Um, I know I sent you the questions beforehand, but I think I also told you that we kinda just go with the flow of the interview. So there’s real expectations but we do want to, in the end, understand something about your political development. Um, why you ended up doing the things that you did during those movement years, um, and get a sense of, you know, what— how Chicanas who embraced, uh, their, sort of, community struggles and feminist struggles at the same time—how they got to that place. Um, and so, one of the ways sometimes we use— one of the things we do to kind of probe this is to ask you about your family history and the influences that you had in your early life, your early development. And sometimes you can think about, for example, when was the first time that you became aware of gender contradictions and gender dimensions, maybe—.",,
,R, Mmhmm. ,,
,I," In your family, in your neighborhood, or when was the first time you realized that racism existed. These kind of first click moments, um sometimes initiate other thoughts and ideas. So begin where you’d like to begin. ",,
,R," Well, thank you. I really appreciate you and Linda being here. And I’m very moved by you and the project you are doing and that Sonia’s doing. And I’d love to talk about my family because, um, you think you’re unto yourself at some egoistic point in your life but really, I look back and it’s the base of my family upbringing that has really formed me. And, uh, I must say, I was raised in a Catholic family and my ancestors are from New Mexico. And so we’ve got years and years of history which I find to be amazing now because when I first entered into the Chicano/ Chicana Movement in the, uh, sixties and seventies, people were saying— especially one of my friends, Antonia Castañada, I had just met her— she was saying, “Interview your family.” And I tell my students that but it doesn’t make any sense to them like it didn’t make any sense to me at the time. I thought, “Well why would anybody want to interview my family? We’re just a family of poor people and struggling. Why would they do that?” But I found out that our families have this incredible history. They have— Chicano history is our family history. So I really credit my family for the amazing things they’ve overcome in their life. ",,
,R,"Both of my parents are from New Mexico and I’m here by “accident of birth” somebody said (laughs). And so, my father was born in Bernalillo, New Mexico and it's one of the oldest land grants that still exists. Its one of the first and maybe one of the first and oldest land grants in New Mexico called Bernalillo. So, when he used to talk about Bernalillo I thought he was talking about some foreign country he was from when I was a kid. Because he would talk about it and it didn’t make sense to me. ",,
,R,"I thought we were Californians and that was it (laughs). But I found out that we’re really connected to Chicano and Mexicano history and that my mother was also from New Mexico. My mother was from— my mother’s parents were from Las Cruces, in that area. And so my grandmother, my great grandmother , actually, was from Paso del Norte. It was called, uh, “Nuestra Señora Guadalupe del Paso del Norte.” And so people think of that as El Paso, but all that— people need to understand, all that was one land at one point. This was Mexican land. And, so, my great grandmother was born in the mission of Our Lady of Guadalupe and the mission is the oldest mission from the 1600s. So, talk about history. That’s our history. And so, we were part of it and that’s just amazing. ",,
,R,"My great grandmother’s name was Macedonía Cruz and she married, actually, one of the invading army soldiers. And his name was Charles Henry Coleman. And it turns out that he seemed to have a sentiment for the people. He became, um, a part of the Mestizo culture. IN other words, at one time in history, it was going to be a multicultural society until, of course, racism dominates and then the Mexican people are reduced to workers. Only workers. So that’s the sad part. But, uh, yeah, he was part of this mestizo culture. He had to learn Spanish, he spoke Spanish and, so, that’s part of that one side of my history. So, I just love that. It’s amazing. ",,
,R,"Then, on my father’s side, the history goes back, well, to the first landings of the Spanish. And people say, “Spanish? We’re not Spanish!” (Laughs) And it’s shocking but yes we are! Spanish and Indian. And you can see it right there in New Mexico history where you can see the, uh, intermarriage of our ancestors—the Spanish and the Indian. And, I think for a long time it was a shock to the people because they’ve tried so hard to preserve their culture. Talk about trying to preserve a culture. The Spanish people trying to hold on to their Spanish traditions. Oh. It was really really hard. And then if you married into the Indian culture it was kind of hush-hush. I work with people that are doing their genealogy and you discover that— they are discovering their history and they are realizing that it's really important. ",,
,R,"I guess one thing I’d like to say about that it that in writing about it, you—in discovering it— you want to write about it, you want to preserve it, and then people start to read about it and then they start to become educated. And I always say you don’t have a consciousness until you get it. So, we all had lack of consciousness and at some point in history we found out something and learned something new that we weren’t taught. And that’s the beginning of our, our new consciousness. So I guess being a Chicana/Chicano Studies teacher and writing, um, I decided to come from the Indian perspective. Because, even though we’re of mixed ancestry, even with this uh, Soldier, US soldier in our family— one of the greatest contradictions of our life is that we have the Spanish, the Indigenous, and the Mexicano in there. And how do you deal with that? It’s so painful and so difficult at times. ",,
,R,"And even members of my own family will say, “We’re Americans.” And so that adds to the contradictions. We are all of that. And so discovering that step by step I think is the beginning of my consciousness. But by the time I got to write and I got to share my thoughts on paper, I wanted to talk about the Indian Ancestry. So the first  paper I got was called, Embracing our Indian Ancestry. And it was this discovery of my Indian ancestry in my genealogy search. And in that discovery I was able to write a paper and present it to the genealogy journals, um, the New Mexico Journal of the Genealogical Society. And I didn’t realize it but that was fairly new to people. They hadn’t dealt with the painful recognition that we have this mestizaje in our culture. So, um, you can’t just throw things at people. You can’t just throw it in their face. That’s not what it’s about. But it's been a journey for all of us. We’ve all found something in our ancestral history that’s really important to what it means to be a Chicano/Chicana in history. ",,
, I," I’m curious about how you traced your lineage to the, to the border and to New Mexico. As, in fact, it’s the case that many of the California women that we have spoken to have connections to New Mexico and that part of the Southwest. It’s very interesting. When did your family come to California? So that, uh, you grew up in San Bernardino?",,
,R, Yes. ,,
,I," So  what was that like, growing up in San Bernardino as a Chicana young woman who still didn’t know that history, didn’t have that to hold onto?",,
,R," Yeah. Well, as you know, we’re— I’m a product of the fifties. So it was the americanization, the assimilation process that was in place. And so what my mother tells us is that somebody came to the door and told my parents that we should stop speaking Spanish. But I guess I’m getting ahead of myself because you asked me how we got to California. And my father, um, my father’s father, so my grandfather that I never knew, because all of my grandparents died before I was born. But, I’m sad about that. I wish I had known my grandparents. I always encourage young people to get to know their grandparents and talk to them because I never got to know mine. And when you read about them and learn about them through documents you want to ask them questions. So ask them now, while they’re alive. ",,
,"But yes, my father, my grandfather, uh, as I said, was born in Bernalillo. His parents were born in Bernalillo, their parents were born in Bernalillo, they went way back. So, um, I did my ancestry and I went as far back as twelve generations and family stories are so amazing. And it turns out my grandfather got a job in the railroad, the Southern Pacific Railroad, because that was just coming up through New Mexico at the turn of the century. So he started traveling on the train between New Mexico and Los Angeles. And, um, so they ended up buying a house in San Bernardino. And he said, “We were kind of in between two states. We were between San Bernardino, California and we were between Bernalillo, New Mexico. So, that’s kind of what happened. ",,,
,"The story is fairly dramatic, too, actually, in that my grandmother had twelve children and her first one was baptized there in the Bernalillo church. I visited there and I visited the cemetery and it's just amazing to look and touch history by going to visit where your ancestors were born. But, uh, I heard the story from my parents from the time I was a little kid. And it was a very painful story for my father to tell so he— and he didn’t talk very much. But basically what happened was they were living in San Bernardino at the time and my grandmother was expecting and she died in childbirth with her twelfth child. ",,,
,"So basically, when you talk about women’s struggle, I began to see it in the lives of my very own family members. My grandmother got married at age 15, um, I have a beautiful wedding picture of her. Um, it looks idealistic. The church is beautiful. All their ancestors before them— I have their names on a s— hand written on a little book that they still have there. But she lost her first two leo— they call them the two Leopoldos. That was the family name. And my father was supposed to be named Leopoldo as well but she was afraid to name my father Leopoldo after she lost two. So he became Leonidas, uh, Leonidas Nicolas Sanchez. And, um, um, anyway, they had more children, many more children. And her twelfth child—her name was Dolores, by the way. Talk about symbolism. ",,,
,I, Mmhmm. ,,
,R," Uh, and there’s so much of it— it’s so much more than symbolism, isn’t it? Because she is Dolores, which means “dolor” in Spanish, or pain or suffering. And, uh, her last child that was born was named Dolores and was now an orphan, so to speak, because her mother had died. ",,
,"So, and the other thing about my grandmother, she was born on, it’s called, the feast of San Lorenzo. And the Feast of San Lorenzo has incredible historical consequences. Uh, it was actually the feast of the survival of the Spanish at the Pueblo Indian Revolt in 1680. So it’s a tragic history on both sides. I’ve read both sides. It’s so painful for the Spanish and the Indians because the Spanish actually exiled the Indians out of New Mexico in 1680 and, uh, well, as you can see I could talk about our Chicano/Chicana history forever but— my grandmother died in childbirth and my father tells the very sad story as they all surrounded her bed trying to keep her alive and she just died right in front of them. And, uh, so my grandmother Dolores is the representation for me of the Chicana, Mexicana, Hispana woman and yet, it’s not just about tragedy. Its about these incredible women who survived an immense amount of, uh, pain and suffering and struggle and emerged these beautiful and, uh, did amazing things!",,,
,"I have this picture of my grandmother with all of her children, her eleven children around her. Well, not elven, actually nine, because, remember, two had passed away. And that she’s pregnant, the other one hadn’t been born yet. And they’re all dressed really nicely and I’m thinking, “How did she, how did they do that? You know, how did she do that with eleven children?” And then my uncle told me that she made all of their clothes and even the boys’ suits. ",,,
,"So these were amazing, amazing, amazing women and I just really give credit to them. So we got to California (laughs), to answer your question, because my—because of Chicano/Chicana history. Because my—they came to New Mexico because, um, of the railroad. And there’s a whole history that needs to be written about that— of the people that have been in the railroad. And then she died on I Street in San Bernardino in that house. And my grandfather went back to New Mexico to ask his sister—her sister, Dolores’ sister’s name was Lorenza. I guess my tía Lorenza, even though I never met her, she was asked to marry my grandfather ‘cause that was the tradition. ",,,
,"And Chicanas were strong in those days too. She said, “No.” But what she did is, she said, “I will adopt the baby officially.” So she adopted baby Dolores and raised her as her own. And did not tell her. And when she was a young girl, her sisters, my dad’s sisters told her that she was adopted and she was really their sister and her mother had died when she was a baby. So, there’s all these amazing stories! ",,,
,"My mother has an amazing story. There’s her husb— her father, my grandfather was part of Los Mineros. Paul Espinoza has documented Los Mineros in uh, Clifton-Morenci and that’s where my mother was born. She was part of the New Mexico tradition. Her mother was from New Mexico, but he was a miner. So when she was— when they were in Clifton, that’s when my mother was born. So she happens to be born in Clifton, Arizona. So, her mother was educated because when her father died, and uh, I didn’t tell you this yet but he was a part of the US invading Army. Talk about— talk about contradictions in our lives as Chicanas, Mexicanos. ",,,
,"Uh, he was the US invading army that married the Mexican-Indian woman. He was Charles Henry Coleman that married Macedonia Cruz. And, so, the children were Amelia Coleman was my grandmother, my mother’s mother. And, um, they lived in southern New Mexico. My great grandfather is actually one of the founders of Las Cruces. People don’t know this, but Las Cruces came after the US takeover. And Las Cruces is actually demanded to— by the Mexican people that they start their own town because they were actually in Doña Ana and they were basically raping the women there when they came in. ",,,
,"‘Cause they were part of their Missouri, um, soldiers. Some of those soldiers—my grandfather luckily, happily, was not part of this group— but when the Missouri soldiers came in they really mistreated the people. They moved right into Doña Ana which was one of the oldest land grants there on the border when the US-Mexico takeover. And they actually just moved right in on the town and just celebrated because, you know, that— they were winning the battles and the women suffered very much. And, so, they wanted to maintain their own Mexican traditions in Doña Ana and later Mesilla it was called after the US takeover and, uh, so my great grandmother was part of that tradition. She’s actually one of the people, the first founders of La Mesilla, which is called the Gadsden Purchase, uh, if you remember your history, um, what happens there after the US takeover", the Mexican people move and form their own little community to be on the Mexican side of the border and they name in La Mesilla. And the US eventually takes that over too. ,,
,"But we have found a census of all the first people in La Mesilla and my grandmother and her mother, her name was Betalia Letisma, uh, she was also on the census. And these census are amazing because they’re all hand-written in script. And they kept these records so carefully. And so, yeah, these women were amazing. Um, she, she died. My great grandmother died when my grandmother was only eight years old. So they had to put her in a convent and the convent had just happened. ",,,
,"And again, I’m talking about women. Because women were the sisters who came out to educate the children. And they almost died coming out. They had to cross the river and they almost died. It— one of the priests said, “Make the sign of the cross in the act of contrition because you’re not going to make it across.” But they did. They made it across. So my mother— grandmother— was raised by the Sisters of Loretto from the time she was eight years old. ",,,
,I, I’ve been to La Mesilla. Its a really incredible place. ,,
,R," Yes. Dina Gonzalez at a conference—we were at a conference and I said, “Dina, we’re here in Las Cruces—“ which Rich— my husband Richard Griswold was giving the keynote speech, actually on the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hídalgo ‘cause he had written that book on the Treaty of Guadalupe- Hídalgo and uh, he said, “Do you want to go with me to this?” And we had just gotten married. It was about 1996 or ’97. “Yes! That’s where my ancestors are from.” And he said, “Well, I don’t know it's some little podunk town called Doña Ana.” (Laughs) And I found out later that’s where my grandmo— where my ancestors on my mother’s side were born. But, yeah, La Mesilla was amazing. ",,
,"I asked Dina Gonzalez, she was there giving a presentation at a conference and I said, “What do we do while we’re here?” And she said, “Well there’s this cute little place over there called La Mesilla, you should go see it. It’s just like the Spanish courtyards used to be with the church in the center and all the shops around it.” And that’s where my grandmother was from. ",,,
,I," And I think the convent is on that main square, it’s now, uh, something else. ",,
,R," Oh, sadly its a shopping mall, yeah. The convent used to be right there on the square and now it's a shopping mall. ",,
,I, It’s gone? ,,
,R," It’s gone, yeah.  It’s gone. And sadly, so, in the Las Cruces the church was Saint Genevieve's and Saint Genevieve's is gone. And a Chicano wrote a dissertation on it. And it's kind of giving me goose bumps right now because (laughs) because what it says is so true of our history. It said we were so tight a community before the intrusion of the US. We were so tight a community, our communities were church-centered. And that’s where we had the music, the jamaicas, the fiestas, the feast days of the celebration of our saints days, our birthdays, the weddings, the, the, um, confirmations, the first communions, the baptisms. We had an amazing, incredible culture that was—all we had to do— this dissertation says— was take the church away. ",,
,"And when they took Saint Genevieve’s out of Las Cruces, they, they destroyed the culture. Or they never destroyed the culture but they, they broke up the culture there. You still have the cemetery right there, right where next to where Las Cruces was, and that’s where some of my ancestors are buried, but you don’t have the church. The community was— they tried to dissipate our communities by taking the church away. ",,,
,I, Mmhmm. ,,
,R, Destroying it. I love that dissertation. Its unpublished. But you can find it in the Las Cruces library if anybody wants to— yeah. ,,
,I," So, um, at some point I do want to return to this question of genealogy and  your interest in history and, um, because I do think it’s, you know, uh, it’s an important part of your trajectory, right, as a Chicana, and your history. And I want to ask you— I guess maybe we’ll just go along this route for a little bit, the history route. ",,
,R," Alright, and then do you want to interrupt me? ",,
,I/R, (Laugh),,
,I," So if you think about your trajectory as a student and later as a professor, um, when did you first become interested in genealogy in particular? Because you have a lot of writing in genealogy, a lot of writing. And you’ve gone back and traced that history and the complexities of it. ",,
,R," Yes, yes, and one of the essays that I wrote was about my great grandparents but when I turned it in they said, “We’re not really interested in your great grandparents.” And, I said, “Okay.” And I took a look at that and I said these were the first mestizos. It was gonna be a mestizo nation. It was supposed to be Spanish and English and it wasn’t. And you can trace it back. When you trace back the genealogy you can see the men were speaking Spanish. And then they made sure that the invasion was bigger than just a physical invasion and a multicultural society. Pretty soon it was making sure that all the books were in English, the history was in English, that it was about the English and it was about the US, but, uh, ask me the question again ‘cause it just went away really briefly. ",,
,I," I’m just curious, um, in your trajectory as an intellectual and a scholar and a teacher when you first became interested in genealogy. And, you know, you started with, what’s intriguing to me is— Antonia Cantañada same to you— is when you were much younger, just beginning, um, you know, interviewing your family. Um, you know, interview your family which is basically what genealogy is. So, when did you come to the awareness that that was what was really going to be your passion as a scholar?",,
,R," I— much later, unfortunately. But I attribute it to, always, to Antonia. Because Antonia influenced me so much. And even though I’m older than she, she’s kind of a mentor  because she is, she was a graduate student in history and I was coming in late as a pre-entry mother with two little kids. ",,
,I, And this was in what years? ,,
,R," In 1970. So, yeah. In 1970. And she— nobody really talked to me, but Antonia did. And she talked to me about who we were, why we were there, and how important it was. Otherwise, I would have just gone through and gotten my degree and left. I didn’t know what to do. But, there were people there that were active. And they didn’t care if you didn’t have any consciousness or not. They were about raising consciousness. ",,
,"So I’ve always said that to my students. If somebody says something in class and everyone laughs or something like that, none of us really had consciousness until we got it or until somebody said something to us. But I really credit Antonia for that and other women who have reached out to other women and I think what I see today is I see the connection that I didn’t see then between those of us that were working, that were students at Stanford and the ones that were students at San Diego State. Here we were really doing the same work, and we just didn’t know it. We hadn’t met yet is the way I like to put it. And so the Las Chicanas that were doing their work here at San Diego State, we were doing similar similar struggles and similar things where we were and we came together eventually. ",,,
,"We were all in the same movimiento chicana. So I just wanted to say that. But to answer your question about how I got involved with that, I always wanted to do research. And one day there was a NAACS conference that I went to. I’m seeing Ricardo Sanchez there, so it must have been about 1990. And, uh, I remember the Matachines from New Mexico. And I said, “Oh my god, that’s where my parents were from!” Bernalillo New Mexico. And they were talking— it was Tijerina, was just coming out and talking about the land grant issues and I said, oh my God my parents told us that we were part of the land grant as well and I want to know more about it. So I went up to all of these people on stage and I said, “Do you know my father? Do you know my grandfather?” And of course nobody did. They left there in 1900. (laughs) So, anyway, they didn’t know. But I’ve always been on this “Who Am I” search. Who is my mother? Who is my father? Who’s my grandfather? ",,,
,There’s a book about it. And they had this b— my parents had this box of pictures and it was always like under their bed. And they would go to the movies and I would go in their room and I would pull out the box of pictures and I would start looking at all these faces. And I was just absolutely fascinated that there was this world of people out there and I didn’t know anything about them. Didn’t know who they were. ,,,
,My father couldn’t talk about it. It was so painful that his mother died when he was fourteen years old and that they were all left. And four years later his father was killed in a railroad accident. And so at nineteen he was the oldest one. And so they were just completely orphaned at that age. And they all took care of each other so they all remained nuevomexicanos (laughs) you know. Trying to preserve their identity and culture.,,,
,I, And they were in San Bernardino.,,
,R," And they were in San Bernardino. And my father— my grandfather— had refused to go back to Bernalillo because, um, my grandmother’s sister didn’t marry him. So, go figure. ",,
,I, Did he get married? Ever? ,,
,R," Um, there’s a little story that he ended up with a woman that was helping take care of the kids, that they got together. Now, whether they got married or not I don’t know. But as far as— if saying that in our family— we weren’t ever allowed to say anything like that (laughs). So for me to say it on tape is kind of shocking now. ",,
,I, (Laughs),,
,R," But I always wondered who we were. And I felt kind of different and I didn’t know who we were. And I always wanted to know, “Why do we do this mamá? Nobody else does it.” Like, my mother raised us Catholic and they were so— she was so faithful. So how could I ever go against the village that I was raised in because my mother was the kindest, most loving, most generous, most giving woman I’ve ever met in my life. And my— people used to tell me, “Who is your mother? I’ve never met anyone like your mother before. She’s like a saint.” ",,
,"And she wasn’t a saint, you know, in terms of proselytizing about the church. She was not— I asked her once, I said mamá, “How com you’re always giving food to the poor?” And she said, “My mother would not eat anything unless she put a plate outside the door.” In Las Cruces when she was growing up. And I was like, okay and I— I don’t think that was passed on to me as much but my mother was amazing. ",,,
,"So, I was raised in the church. Um, very strongly. My father didn’t go to church (laughs) I guess that’s traditional. And I wanted to know who we were. So I started writing letters to New Mexico. I’d write ‘em to uh, you—whatever sources you have as community sources. Civil offices or libraries. I heard that the library knew a lot of history so I wrote a letter to the library, never got an answer. So, to answer your question, when Richard said do you want to go to this little podunk town called Doña Ana I went there and while he was in the conference I met this woman who was the head of the library and I told her about my family and she said, “Well let’s see what we can find.” ",,,
,"Went to the lower—searched, searched, searched, searched, couldn’t find anything. She said, “There’s a whole Coleman-Cruz family in New Mexico that’s called, um, well, Coleman Cruz and they are from Colorado.” And I said, “No, that’s not us. We’re not from Colorado.” Well, I got home a few weeks later, I get this big package in the mail and it says your family is from Colorado but it’s not from Colorado the state, it’s Colorado, New Mexico. It was— my great grandfather was from a little town called Colorado and when the US came down they called it Roadie, which means “rad” or “ready” or something like that. ",,,
,"But they americanized Colorado and called it “Roadie.” And so, that’s how I found my ancestry and I couldn’t stop after that. I started searching and, um, one of the ancestries is and— um, that’s because of Richard inviting me, by the way (laughs). Richard inviting me to go to New Mexico. And then the other story is that um, um, I was— I met the cousins. ",,,
,"So once I found out that we were from this little town called Roadie I met this Coleman cousin and we talked on the phone and he said, “You know, our great grandfather knew Cochise.” And so guess what I said in my head? “Yeah, sure.” (Laughs). So I thought it was just a funny story and I didn’t follow up on it. So, eventually I started looking in the old papers of— they had newspapers in the 1800s in Las Cruces and the area there. So I started looking at the old newspapers. We went to the library and I asked for Richard to help me. And he said, “Okay.” So he went and he said, “I looked in all the newspapers and I couldn’t find anything.” And I know that I’m one of these people that has to go like, chu-chu-chu, step-by-step and no stone unturned (laughs) so I actually went back and re-did  what he did and when I did I found my great grandfather. And it was an amazing story. He actually met the Apache Chief Cochise and they went camping together. What!",,,
,I— when my kids got home I said I didn’t  believe a word he said ‘cause he got it through oral history. So I searched further and ten years after that there was a peace talk between Cochise and the US soldiers and they invited my great grandfather to go along because he was a soldier in the US Army. And he— they knew he knew Cochise ten years ago. ,,,
,"So when they went to meet— there’s a blow-by-blow description in 1870, uh, newspaper called The Border, The Las Cruces Border, and the whole story is there. And I was just amazed when I read it. I mean, almost cried. Well, I did cry (laughs). I brought it home to my kids, they were in high school then, and I said, “Look at this.” And we read it together and I said, “Your great, great, great grandfather knew Cochise, the Apache chief.” (Laughs) So that’s the title of the book that I first wrote. And the way that I did that is my sister was working for the um, uh, she was working as a community, um, what do you call that when they— a publications officer or something— when they have to go meet people, invited them and that sort of thing. Sorry, I can’t—  my sister is Mary Sanchez. She actually started a newspaper called Aztlán in a college in, uh, near San Bernardino. And, uh, she did that about the same time that I wrote the paper on Cochise. ",,,
,"But, I really attribute everything to my sisters. I have no reason to even be here (laughs) doing any of this. My sisters were really the scholars. I— I’m not so much. They are the ones. They paved the way, my older sisters. And then I have two younger sisters as well, they’re amazing. But, um, my sister Mary was a journalist and she worked for the San Bernardino Sun Telegram. She’s an award-winning journalist, actually. And, uh, she says, “Don’t talk about me, talk about yourself.” (Laughs) That’s what she always tells me, so that’s what she’d be saying right now. ",,,
,"But my sister is, she was Girls State. I don’t know if you know about that but Girls State is, um, in the 1950s they took two, two girls out of every high school in California and sent them to Sacramento for a leadership conference and my sister was one of the two at San Bernardino High School in 1953. So she went to the leadership conference and at the leadership conference she was the journalist that did the newsletter, so that’s history. ",,,
,"So it’s Chicana History. They don’t use that term, but I was the one that was involved in the Chicano/Chicana Movement. But they’re my predecessors and they’re the ones that did everything. She— when I went to high school and I didn’t know what to major in and I just said, “Well, I guess I’ll major in journalism ‘cause that’s what my sister majored in.” (Laughs) So they were the ones that did the leg work. And then my sister, Teresa, she was in the choir and my parents couldn’t afford music lessons for all of us so they gave them to my sister Teresa, who played the violin. And she was in choir and orchestra. And so, she— I was in choir because my sister Teresa was in choir (laughs). And my sister Josephine came home reciting the Preamble to the US Constitution. She’s my oldest sister. Um, she’s 85 now. She’s the class of ’49 I think. ",,,
,I," Well, you know, you, in the mean time they were doing all of these things and you were under your parents’ bed pulling out those photographs. ",,
,R, That’s right! (Laughs).,,
,I, You too were in training.,,
,R, (Laughing) exactly!,,
,I," So, I’m curious about this— it is unusual for children that age to be interested in the history in that way. To have that spark and—.",,
,R, Mmhmm. ,,
,I," So, I’m wondering if you can recall your time in high school and coming up to young adulthood, um, where you went to college and all of that stuff, and, and you know, sort of what your experiences were during that time. ",,
,R, Yeah. ,,
,I," I imagine it would be, it would have been the early to mid sixties, probably? ",,
,R, No. (Laughs),,
,I, (Laughs),,
,R," Older than that. My daughter’s gave me a 75th birthday party last year and they said, “Momma—” I said, “How could you do this to me?” And they said, “Momma, the jig’s up. Everyone’s gonna know it now. You’re 75 years old and get over it!” (Laughs) But anyway, yeah, I did look at those pictures and long for something, some connection in my life to my ancestors and, uh, yeah, and then in high school I, I was gonna say something. It might pop back in. I’ll just leap to high school then. ",,
,"Because of my sisters, as you say, I majored in journalism in high school. So I became and editor of The Weekly. They put out a weekly at San Bernardino High School. So, talk about Mexican Americans involved in a mixed community and it’s all run by anglos at the time. Well, uh, my sister was one of the forerunners and she was the first, uh, person to go to Girl State, as far as I know. Maybe there were people before her, I don’t remember. But, um, I joined the newspaper and so I became the editor of the weekly— Tyro Weekly. We published a newspaper every week. So I became, in my senior year I became the assistant editor of the newspaper and, uh, acting editor at one time when the editor was gone. And we had to put out the paper. And I just did it on my bed. We didn’t have a desk. So I put it— laid it out on my bed. We didn’t have computers, of course, in those days. And I felt like I had this sort of artistic talent to do it, to make the right choices about type and layout and photos. And that sort of thing. ",,,
,"And, um, we had to, uh, interview people and we had to gather the news. I remember one year the, um, student council, which was mostly all white, I’m pretty sure— I’m trying to remember if I was on the student council, um, or not. But one year they were gonna have a dance and they were gonna announce the winners of the election at the dance. And everybody said well you have the election results now you need to give us the election results. And they said, “No. We’re gonna have it at the dance.” So the kids that were putting on the dance were keeping the election results. ",,,
,"So, I don’t know how I did this, (laughs) it was my big scoop. But I don’t know how I did it but I got the election results from somewhere, but I got the official election results. So I published them in the newspaper. And they came out as front page news in the Tyro Weekly. And the students were so upset because they had promised everybody they were gonna announce it at the dance. Well, we didn’t go to dances. Our parents wouldn’t let us go to dances so we weren’t gonna go to any dances. And there was only gonna be an exclusive group, and mostly, maybe the anglo kids, I don’t know, I can’t remember how it was. If it was that discriminated then. I’ll have to think about that a little bit. But that was one of the things that, that, uh happened.",,,
,I, You’re a radical! A radical journalist.,,
,R," (Laughs) I guess it starts out being that way, you know, now that you think about it. And then people— you know when they said that you’re an activist, I thought, well you’re not really an activist, you know, but you are an activist. Because what you did to make something right is being an activist, I guess. So that’s the way to look at it. ",,
,I," And had you already, this— so when you graduated from high school were you already planning to go to college? ",,
,R," I, I attribute going to college to the fact that I saw all the girlfriends that I had— a lot of the girlfriends that I had— anglo girlfriends going to college. And they’re all getting ready to go to college and I’m like, “Hey! How come I’m not going to college? I have good grades, why am I not going to college?” And so one of my girlfriends said that she had gone to her counselor ‘cause she didn’t like her history course. It was too difficult. She wanted to change to another class. So I was in the academic program too, so I go to a counselor. I thought, “Oh, you can go to a counselor?” I didn’t even know you could go to a counselor. So I go to a counselor and I say I want to go to college and I want to see what courses I’m taking. And she says, “You’re in the wrong place.” ",,
,"And I said, “Well, why?” And she said, “Well, you’re not gonna go to college.” And I said, “Well, I want to go to college and my girlfriends are going to college.” And she said, “ Well how are you gonna go to college? You don’t have any money. Costs a lot of money to go to college. Your parents are poor people and they can’t send you to college.” And I said, “Okay.” And I was seventeen or eighteen, seventeen or eighteen at the time. ",,,
,"So, she told me I couldn’t go to college. She changed my major. She said, “You really shouldn’t be in this course. You should be in this secretarial course.” And so she changed me to the secretarial course. And I remember being in that secretarial course and it was about typing and it was about trying to take shorthand and it was— and I was thinking differently. I was— you had asked me where it first began and I was gonna say it was with my mother and sister— sisters. Because when I was little, we didn’t have toys. We didn’t have a lot of things or a lot of food. We basically ate beans and rice ‘cause my father was a hard worker. He worked for the railroad as well, as I recall. And other places. And my mother had— we were eleven kids. So I was seventh of eleven. ",,,
,"And we were poor. I mean, we had to take our shoes off when we got home from school because my father was afraid they’d get worn off ‘cause we’d go outside and play jump rope. In the summer, no shoes! You did not wear any shoes in the summer time (laughing). ",,,
,I, You gotta save ‘em! ,,
,R," You gotta save ‘em. So that was us. So, Christmas, we didn’t get gifts. We had the most rich, beautiful Christmas because of my mother. She made empanadas, she put the tree up, she— um, my sisters put the tree up. My mother basically— we didn’t really have that tradition of the tree. My mother— it was about midnight mass. We went to midnight mass. And it was all about going to mass, walking with my sisters to confession on Saturday (laughing), uh, you know, it was— we were kind of a tight family. ",,
,I, Did you have a nacimiento? Did she do a manger scene? ,,
,R," We had a— yes. But not in the artistic— everything was very simplified with my mother because she had to work work work to get the next meal on the table three times a day so (laughs), so um, yeah. My mother— I look back on the incredible memories my mother made for us because we built up to getting ready for midnight mass. We got all— polished our shoes we got our clothes ready, um, we went to midnight mass, we came home, and she made empanadas. So its midnight! She’s in there making empanadas. And she’s not complaining. She never complained at all, in her whole life. And she did it for us! Oh, it was beautiful. I loved my growing up. It was, it was pretty cool. ",,
,I," So, Rita, you were just telling us about your Christmases which were full of food and tradition, but not so much full of gifts. ",,
,R," Yeah, I asked my uncle about that. I said, “Did you exchange gifts? Did you have trees?” And he said, “No but we went to somebody’s house.” He said, “We took food to them and when we came back, we took armfuls of food away.” He said, “We shared the food that we made.” And he said it was very festive. That was New Mexico and my mother brought those traditions with her. And our Christmases— we didn’t have a lot of gifts but I don’t remember ever having a sad Christmas. And I remember, one time, my dad’s friend, he called him “Chris” he was an anglo guy, his name was Chris Stubenville.  He helped our family a whole bunch. But anyway, I won’t get off on that story. I, I guess what I want to say is he brought a piggy bank that he had put money in all year and gave it to us as a Christmas gift. ",,
,"And when we broke the piggy bank we counted it up to be a hundred dollars. And we were just amazed. We had never seen that much money before. Well, when we went to go shopping, I was just a little kid then, I was only five or less. And my sisters were the ones I observed doing all this. When they went shopping they took me along. They sort of dragged me along, wishing they didn’t have to, probably. And they said each person gets a gift but we only have nine dollars for each person or less for that. So, uh, I got a book. Oh, when I opened it up it was just magical because my mother’s mother taught her to read when she was a little kid for the Sisters of Loretto. ",,,
,"She taught us to read at a very young age. We started reading when we were four and that’s all we did because we had to be quiet, because there were so many kids in the house. Because we didn’t have any toys, so we had to each read a book and we had to— that’s how I started reading. So, yeah. ",,,
,,,,
,,,,
,I, That’s a wonderful Christmas story. Thank you for sharing it with us.,,
,R," Oh, you’re welcome. ",,
,I, So you were also talking about—.,,
,R," Thank you, mamá. (Laughs).",,
,I," (Laughs) You were also talking about, um, this experience that you had with this counselor—R"," Oh, yeah. I"," That not only discouraged you from going to college because of your, um, financial situation and maybe because of your race, um—."
,R, Yes. ,,
,I," And, um, her switching you into secretarial—. ",,
,R, Yes. ,,
,I," The secretarial, I guess it would be called the vocational education track for girls. ",,
,R," Yeah. You could call it that. It says “secretarial” but what it’s saying is that women, like me anyway, women like me couldn’t go to college and that somehow we couldn’t get an education. And, so, I remember that— those courses. And I couldn’t handle ‘em because they were sort of machine courses. You’re typing, you were taking shorthand, and that sort of thing. And then they had— your English wasn’t reading literature. It was bus— called business English. So I was pretty sad about that. I graduated, but I never stopped what I was doing in choir. Which was very enriching, by the way, because we sang with an amazing German master, choir master. And we traveled all over singing. And, uh, we won awards. And he— we won like number one in San Bernardino High School. His name was, uh, Dutch Hauschildt (4",18 ??). ,
,"Anyway, um, and then journalism, um, I had the journalism professor who constantly said, “You can do it. You can go to college.” I said, “Are you sure? No one in my family has ever gone before.” And he pushed us. And we won awards. And so I got to be in competition for a journalism scholarship. And I thought, “Oh my gosh.” And it was because of him. Because of the professor, the teacher at San Bernardino high school. And he was a new teacher because he wasn’t the same teacher my sister had. And I was actually gonna drop out ‘cause I said, “Well, you’re not Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones was my sister’s teacher.” And he said, “Well, yeah but I can— we’re gonna do a lot of good things in here.” And I said, “No, I’m just gonna drop.” And he talked me out of dropping it. So I didn’t drop. ",,,
,"Thats a— everything’s by some little milagro that I’m here today (laughs). But, so I stayed there and, um, in journalism and he got me, encouraged me, and then he selected me to be the writer for the contest and then I did win. It was called the Winifred Martin Journalism Award. And so I won the scholarship and they—when everybody was given scholarship money at the end of the year I used to watch them go up and collect scholarships for college. But I never could understand why I— how did they do it? How did you get in that select group? ‘Cause I knew I got good grades in high school, but why was I not in that group? And he, this journalism professor was responsible for making sure that a lot of the Mexican American kids got recognized and—.",,,
,I, Why do you think that is?,,
,R," Uh, I don’t think it's a good reason, though. I think he was attracted to the young Chicanas, Mexicana girls. So, I’m sorry to say that. It’s really sad. But I didn’t know very mu— I was a very naive person. But as I got older I started thinking about it. And, uh, sexism was alive and well in those days but he helped a lot of us girls get— he paid attention to us, basically. And so, I wasn’t really abused or anything. ",,
,I , So you were about to tell us about this scholarship that you won and about how you got to college after all of this. ,,
,R," Yes. Well, I attribute it to people that were there in my life, as I said before. For whatever reason there were people in my life and I had girlfriend that was, uh, Jewish and she was gonna go to college and she was freely with, uh, diversity. She wasn’t just with the rich white kids that were at San Bernardino High School because that’s what San Bernardino High School was. Its a very class-divided, very, very wealthy and then the poor people there too. So the class divisions are really really strong in San Bernardino. And so there’s kind of this aspiring. Wanting to aspire, ‘cause you know you’re good and how come I’m not there type of thing and that’s good ‘cause you’re so, “What’s going on here? Why am I not there as well?” ",,
,"And so the journalism was the, the driving force. And it wasn’t just the journalism teacher. He was only a little part of it. But it was the people that were also the journalist. So my friend, Judy, Judy Daniels, she’s uh, she was Jewish. She was part Jewish, I’m sure. She was Catholic and Jewish, that’s all I remember about her (laughs). Uh, and she, uh, said you know, “We’re going to college. Forget all those rich kids whose parents can afford it. We can’t afford it but we can still go.” And so she pushed it. ",,,
,"Well, we got the applications, we started filling them out. But we thought we were gonna be world-famous journalists. We were kids and we thought— and we could’ve probably! But what happened was we started filling out the applications and, um, one day she— and my father liked her, too. He liked Judy. She was a really good friend of mine. And so she came over to the house and she said, “My friend—” it’s a guy— “my friend is going to San Francisco.” And he said that he would give us a ride to the college and we could look at it. And I said, “My father is never gonna let me go.” He did not let my sister go to Girls State. He wasn’t gonna let my sister go to Sacramento. But a teacher came to the house and talked him into it and then she was able to go. ",,,
,"Well, that’s what happened. Judy came, the friend came, they talked about, um, he could drive us to the college and leave us off there. Um, he could go do the business that he needed to do and then pick us up and drive us back. And my father said, “Yes.” (Laughs) So, another milagro, right? So, we drove to— I remember driving through Pismo Beach and seeing how beautiful that was. That’s one of the memories I have. We went to the college and we looked around and we found a place to live at a house that had a room with twin beds and we found it where we were gonna live and everything. And, uh, oh my gosh. So we start saving for college. We apply and we get accepted to college. And I’m a journalism major at San Jose State now, as a freshman. And so is Judy. And so we got jobs working for the telephone company in the summer and, uh, I was saving every penny because I’m living at home, of course. And so is Judy. But Judy is coming dressed to the teeth with these fabulous clothes! And I’m going, “Judy, how did you afford that and save?” And she said, “Oh, I’m saving.” ",,,
,"Well one day her little checkbook, or little—we used to have these little bank books— fell out of her purse. And I saw it fall and I went, “Oh” and I looked at it and she had saved twenty-five dollars. And I said, “Twenty-five dollars? I’ve saved five hundred dollars!” So I said, “Judy, what is up with this?” And she said, “Well, I’m still going, I’m still going. I can still save enough to go.” And I said, “Judy, you’re not saving. You have to start saving.” Well, a week before, “Judy, are you going?” ‘Cause I couldn’t go by myself. ",,,
,"She’s not going. She backed out. I was going to college by myself. My girlfriend was no longer going. And I knew my father was gonna say no. So my sisters started working on my father. And they started saying, “Well, you know, Judy’s backing out of going to school now, and so, I could go with Rita, get her settled there, and come back.” And they talked my father into it. And so, I didn’t have a way to go, a ride, to go, I didn’t have anything. So I started calling old friends of mine. Girlfriends and guys that I knew from high school to see if I could get a ride up ‘cause they were going to a college up north or something to get a ride with them. But they weren’t calling me back. So I would just call and call and call. Talk to their parents and say, “Could you have my friend call me back?” And nobody was calling me back. ",,,
,"So I just decided— I wasn’t gonna do it. I was too scared. I wasn’t gonna go. And I get a letter from my journalism teacher in the mail about a week before I was going away and it says, “We are so proud of you. You are gonna do really well. You’re gonna do so great.” And… I thought, “I can’t let them down.” That’s why I went. I was too embarrassed to let them down (laughs). So my sister agreed to go with me on the bus and I remember the day we left. We said goodbye to my sisters, I was crying my eyes out, and we— we had to go to mass ‘cause it was Sunday. You can’t miss mass. It was one of the things that my girlfriends used to tease me about, “Did you know that Rita’s never missed mass in her whole life?” And so (laughs), and so we went to— they had a five o’clock mass at Our Lady of Guadalupe in San Bernardino. ",,,
,"So we walked in the dark to Our Lady of Guadalupe, went to mass, got on the bus and we drove— my sister drove me. My sister and I went together. My older sister, Mary, who should have been the one that got her college degree. She actually went to community college, San Bernardino Valley College and she was the editor of the, uh, San Bernardino Valley College Journal, um, annual. And she graduated with honors and everything but she got a job as a reporter at the San Bernardino Sun Telegram. So no slouch there.",,,
," So, uh, she encouraged me.  I had to take the tests— the English “A” Tests. And she said, “If you pass it I’ll buy you some argyle socks.” ‘Cause that was the fashion (laughing) those days"," bermuda shorts and argyle socks! So, anyway, that’s how I got to college. And, so, I was alone in that room. There were twin beds but I was alone. I lived with this family and I walked to— we were stupid. I got a place too far away from San Jose State and had to walk several blocks to college but that’s where I lived while I went. And, uh—.",,
,I, What did you major in?,,
,R, Journalism.,,
,I, Mmhmm. ,,
,R," I was a journalism major, yeah. So. ",,
,I, And how long were you there? This must have been in ’57? ,,
,R, That’s the crucial question.,,
,I, (Laughs.),,
,R," And it also has to do with women. And Chicanas. Because I was raised to— my sis— my older sister got married and it was really one of the most beautiful memories I have of watching my sister get ready for her wedding. And she has eight beautiful children and she had a beautiful husband. And she got married. My next sister, Terry, married Robert Ibarra. Teresa married Robert Ibarra. They’ve been married for sixty years tomorrow, August 9th. Or, in a couple of days they’ll be married for sixty years. They met in high school. So that’s what it was about. And so when I was in college I met a boy and he liked me and, uh, you just thought you were an adult and you were ready for the world. And, so, he proposed to me and I was a freshman in college and I go home and tell my parents, “I’m engaged!” And they’re like, “What?” ",,
,"And I told my sisters, “Well, mom and pop didn’t seem too upset when I told them I was engaged.” Well, the other guys who married my older sisters, they had to go to my dad to ask for their hand in marriage. And it was really a scary moment. But I come in there, out of line, ‘cause my older sister hadn’t gotten married yet, and say, “I’m engaged!” And oh my gosh. I got married when I was— I was nineteen then. And I got married the following semester when I was twenty. And I put my husband through school and stopped going. And he got his bachelor’s degree in business and I put him through Law School and he got his, his, uh, Doctor of Jurisprudence and, uh, passed the bar and ten years later we were divorced. So, that’s that story. ",,,
,I," And this is all happening— so, if I’m doing the calculations right, you know, this marriage, um, this process, is going on in the late fifties and early 1960s. There’s a lot going on at that time. ",,
,R, Mmhmm. ,,
,I," And I’m, I’m, I take it you’re possibly raising children. And what was your— you’re still in San Jose?",,
,R," Yes. And, so, he was accepted to— I must say, I’m not going to say that he did this to me or anything. What I’m saying happened is, once he graduated from college and we had Lisa, my oldest daughter, and, uh, then five years later in 1962 we had, uh, Teana. I named her Lauri. So I wanted Lisa and Lauri and she wasn’t having it. She changed her name when she became an adult. She changed it to “Teana.” Anyway, those are my two older daughters. But, yeah, there was a lot happening politically. And I was working full time and taking care of babies. And I was at home a lot alone. ",,
,"And he was studying and who knows what else. And he was doing, uh, whatever he needed to do to get ahead in the law world. I really shouldn’t have said that. Because I was a very immature person and I didn’t come to terms with that until about a few years ago when I found myself in another broken marriage. I, I was a very immature person. I was a girl getting married. And silly coming home to my parents. The nerve telling them, after all they did for me to help me get to college, and tell them I was engaged. ",,,
,"And then when my father found out that I was working while my husband was going to college he was in shock. He couldn’t believe it. And he couldn’t believe that a man would do that to a young girl and allow her to work full time. But as I said, I was a very immature person and I wanted him to go to college and I thought it would be better for our family. And I encouraged him to go to college. And I— I think I even helped fill out the papers for him to go to college and try to find him scholarships and that sort of thing. And, uh, I noticed he wasn’t filling out the papers and I said, “Uh, aren’t you going to fill out the papers for college? The application?” And he said, “Well, you know, I don’t think this— how are we gonna do this?” And I said, “Well, I don’t get it, what do you mean?” (Laughs) Being immature can have its advantages I guess. But he, uh, graduated from Hastings High School and I lived in San Francisco. I guess you might say that was the loneliest time in my life. Because I was home— I was working, I was home, I was taking care of kids, and I was basically alone at night ‘cause he was studying all the time. And, so, a lot of times he was studying with his friends. ",,,
,"And he was also working part-time in the financial district in San Francisco and he was hanging out with his friends, too. So it was pretty lonely but the way that I reconciled it was he would say, “Well, this is what you agreed to do. Take care of the children. And you agreed to work. And I’m doing this work and together we’ll move forward when I get my law degree.” But it didn’t go that romantically. And, uh, I remember joining the Law Wives Club and the lawyer— they invited a lawyer to come and talk to us or a judge or something and he said, “Well the first thing I want to tell you is the law is a jealous mistress.” And, so, that was the mentality I was in. So. ",,,
,I," Right, so this was—.",,
,R," Immature, unconscious, lost. So. Yeah. ",,
,I," So, how did you get found? ",,
,R," Divorce. I found myself divorced. Yeah. He wanted a divorce. So, he— we had come to this point and he now wanted a divorce. And I was just crushed ‘cause this was like my freshman, my high school boyfriend, basically. My first love. And we had these two beautiful daughters together who I’d given birth to and, yeah, so, he wanted to, to be free and he wanted to move on and do, do other things so that’s what he did. So. And my sisters had to watch me kind of break down. And I think that’s when I had to wake up and do something. I didn’t know what to do but, um, a friend, uh, his brother’s— my sister-in-law, his brother’s wife kind of took me in and said, “Look, you have a life! You’re still in your twenties.” And so, I sa— I thought my life was over. I thought was just gonna die. So, yeah.",,
,I, What year was this? ,,
,R,1968,,
,I," Oh, wow. That’s a big year! A lot is going on in that year. ",,
,R," Oh my gosh, and when I tried to talk— and I remember now talking to him about it and telling him about what was going on in the Black Civil Rights Movement, seeing it on the news and everything. And I’d say,  “But, no, no, we have to do something.” And he’d say, “No, because you—” he said, “you can’t legislate— you can’t change laws except by legislating them.” You can’t go into the streets to legislate morality. That was his thinking. And I said, “No.” And I knew I was right at that time in my life as a young woman that had only had one year of college (laughs). I knew I was right and so that— and it was something my mother taught me, I think. I know. I know it was what my parents taught me. “No, this is not right. You have to do something for others.” You can’t— and waiting to legislate morality when the law is unjust. Is— there’s no justice there. So, yeah. ",,
,I,  Sixty-eight. Sixty-eight in San Francisco? ,,
,R," Yeah, yeah. ",,
,I, I’m just thinking. ,,
,R, Oh we went through the whole Beat Movement and everything.,,
,I, (Laughs) Right? ,,
,R, I went— I’ve heard all the beat poets in all the San Francisco bars—.,,
,I, And you went with him? ,,
,R," Yeah! Because at that time it was cool to do. You know, to go out to dinner and to go hear the beat poets and that sort of—.",,
,I, So were you guys kind of bohemian? ,,
,R," No. No. It was all happening as an observation, you know?",,
,I, Mmhmm. ,,
,R," And you’re, you’re going to watch it and saying— ‘cause when you’re reading about it it’s different when you’re in it. It’s just like a phenomenon that’s occurring at the moment in time and so you’re looking at it and saying, “I wonder why these people are doing this? What does it all mean?” You know, um, Jack Kerouac, or my jazz favorite was Chet Baker (laughs). ",,
,I," Well, San Francisco is a big jazz central. ",,
,R, Yeah. ,,
,I, We talked to Dorinda Moreno and found out such interesting things about her wild life in San Francisco. ‘Cause at this point she’d already owned a beauty parlor—.,,
,R, Oh!,,
,I," She had been a jazz groupie, she’d done a lot!",,
,R," Oh my gosh! Dorinda, I’ll tell you, when I get to college Dorinda was my next, uh, mentor besides Antonia, was Dorinda. ",,
,I," Oh, so well let’s talk about that! So you, it’s 1968—.",,
,R," Yeah, um, I’m divorced. ",,
,I," So you’re divorced, it’s 1968, a lot of things are going on, all of a sudden you’re a free woman, I guess, and, and what? So, for you— after you get over that depression, what’s going on?",,
,R," Yeah, I remember part of the break-up a little bit, and what just flashed, and I have to say it— was, they used to have these bars where they had dancing. I can’t remember what it was called but, uh, I remember a woman in a cage looking up. Oh its called Go-Go Dancing. ",,
,I, Go-Go Dancing. ,,
,R," And he would bring his lawyer friends and I would be there with his lawyer friends and we’d be in a group watching these things going on and I was starting to feel really disconnected. I think its called alienation. I started feeling really, really disconnected. And what happened is when he wouldn’t come home in the evenings is when it was really, really hard for me ‘cause I was lonely. That’s the word that I most— if you don’t have a group of women around you— and you’re not supposed to. You’re supposed to be taking care of yourself. That’s how I was raised. I mean, that’s how women did it in those days. And you didn’t have any— you, you were by yourself, so, yeah. ",,
,"I’ll think of what I was gonna say in a minute. Its just…isolating is the word. ‘Cause you’re at home alone. Women are home alone taking care of babies in a household with no communication with anyone. Its maddening. I mean it’s really, it’s maddening. ",,,
,I," You know who talked about this is Betty Friedan, The Happy Housewife.",,
,R, I read that book. I read it.,,
,I, You read that book?,,
,I," I did. I was shocked. I read it about the time I was married. I was also reading literature, don’t forget. ‘Cause I loved reading books. And that was shocking to him as well because he said, “Well, what are you doing?” ‘Cause I was losing the little girl and I was starting to read books. And when I talked to him about it he was very unhappy about that ‘cause now I was changing. I was becoming a different person. And I thought that was bad ‘cause he was telling me, “Look, you’re not the same person. What happened to the sweet little girl I married?” You know? And then I’d think I was supposed to go back to the sweet little girl that he married. So it was really starting to be painful. Because he wasn’t home he would say, “Well, you’re supposed to be taking care of the home. I’m working in the law offices of Baccigalupi, Acas and Salinger on 333 Montgomery Street in San Francisco (laughing) and you’re supposed to be taking care of the children.” But it was so isolating. I, I’m, I think I’m just figuring it out as we speak. ",,
,"I was starting to lose my mind, getting very troubled. I didn’t understand anything anymore and why— what was happening to me. Uh, I started thinking I better take a course or two and go back to school. So I took, um, Spanish first. Because I decided that I was gonna go back to school and I was gonna major in Spanish. And my parents, remember I told you, somebody had come to the house and said you shouldn’t be teaching your children Spanish in the home. So the younger ones—  I was at the bottom of the 11 kids— we weren’t— all the older kids spoke Spanish and now we weren’t. So I took the course in Spanish and I studied so hard, and I remember getting an A in the class. And then, in San Francisco, um, I took, I took Psychology. And I knew that I had to study really hard ‘cause I wasn’t getting it. So I thought, “Well, I’m not very smart ‘cause I’m not getting it.” Well now I realize how complex a psychology course can be (laughs). You have to be a mathematician. ",,,
,"So I studied so hard and I thought, “I’m never gonna make it through college ‘cause I have to study so hard.” Well, it was in a class of like 300 people at San Francisco City College and, um, the professor said, “Okay the test scores are out. I’m gonna read. We only have, um, ten A’s in the 300 person class and I’m gonna read the names of the people who got the A’s.” ",,,
,"And I go, “Oh, no. I flunked.” And he read my name as one of the A’s. And I thought, “Oh my God I can’t believe it. How did I do that?” I tried every which way to study. I read notes, I talked to myself out loud, I taped ‘em on a tape recorder and played ‘em while I went to sleep (laughs). ",,,
,"There’s no way I wasn’t gonna get an A in that class! But I realized that I could go to college and I could finish. And that’s how I decided to go to college. And I think it was the beginning of the break-up because he came home one day and he said, “You know what, look at this place.” And he said, “This place is a mess. And look the dishes are in the sink.” And I was so embarrassed. I was just, like, crushed. ‘Cause we never did that at home. Mama never let us do that. We did the dishes, you know? ",,,
,"But, I was studying, so I didn’t do the dishes. Kinda like what happened in the last three months (laughing) that Sonia and I have been working on this project. Everything’s gone to pot! And when he said that, that was the first time I fought back. I said, “Wait a minute. But I’m going to school. I put you through school and now I want to go to school. And so now you’re telling me that I haven’t done the dishes.” So, that was the beginning of the end. Yeah, we were divorced. I was so in shock about the whole divorce that I remember somebody called me up and asked me some questions. I was gonna get the car insurance or something and he asked me what day— what year— I was divorced and I couldn’t remember. And they said, “Oh, God! No wonder you’re divorced!” ",,,
,"I couldn’t remember everything. I was just in a fog. So, I did go back to school. I applied to Foothill College ‘cause we were living in Palo Alto. ‘Cause he had gotten a job in Sunnyvale he was now the Assistant City Attorney at Sunnyvale and he was waiting to get a raise to go to be the CIty Attorney. And it wasn’t happening. So he stayed and stayed and that was the time of the break-up and I didn’t want to move because I didn’t want any disruption for my children. I just wanted everything to seem like it was normal so I stayed right there. But I went to Foothill Community College while my children were little girls. Yeah, so, I guess you could say I walked right straight head-on into the Chicano/Chicana Movement. Yeah. ",,,
,"‘Cause I walked in and I’m like, ah, when I went to college I wore a dress. You didn’t wear jeans. And I was all dressed up going to college and I looked around and everybody was wearing jeans with holes in ‘em even! And I’m like. “What is going on?” And I walked right into this girlfriend and I said, “Hi!” And she was pro— I was thirty— so I guess not quite thirty, maybe twenty-nine and she was probably twenty-two or something. And I wanted to talk to somebody so I saw this Chicana coming toward me, this Mexicana and I wanted to talk to her. She said, “Are you a Chicana?” And I said, “What?” (Laughing) I hadn’t even heard the word before. And I said, “No, but I want to be!” I said, “What’s a Chicana?” So she started telling me. ",,,
,"She said, “We’re back here because we’re fighting for our rights. And we have civil rights too! And we have the right to go to college! And it's just like the African American Civil Rights Movement. We’re part of that struggle. Our parents didn’t go to college for a reason.” And I said, “Oh my God that’s my parents.” You know? And, so she said, “And we’re here to talk about it and to change things.” And that was in 1969. And when she said, “Are you a Chicana?” I said, “No, but I want to be.” (Laughing) I don’t think I said that exactly but I always tell people I said that.",,,
,"So that’s how I started going to college. And, remember I told you how I studied for the Psychology test? I— I was afraid of not getting a good grade. And I hadn’t really done well in History and Biology at San Jose State, so, I studied my face off. And I start— I went to a counselor and I said, “ I want to go to college. I want to graduate.” And she said, “You can.” I said— she said, “Well, where do you want to go?” And I said, “Well, I don’t know.” And she said, “Well, you can go anywhere you want.” Wow. As opposed to that other counselor who told me I could never go to college (laughs).  So she told me I could go anywhere I want. And I just said, “Oh my gosh. My sister told me the best college in California was Stanford.” And she said, “You could go to Stanford.” So I applied to UCSB and Stanford. That’s how I got into Stanford (laughs). So. ",,,
,I, When did you start and Stanford? ,,
,R," As soon as I got my grades and applied and got accepted— oh, oh! I decided I, I, I said, “I’m not gonna chance it this time, I gonna go to the college and go to the admissions office and say, ‘look this is my last chance. I’m not a young person applying here I’m thirty years old and I have two children.” And in those days that wasn’t that popular to be a single mom. I was kinda like an odd one. So I went and talked to them about it and they said, “You, you’re right up there. You’ve got your grades, you’ve got your requirements out of the way. Go ahead and apply.” And so I did and I was accepted, so, yeah. That’s what happened. ",,
,I, What was that like? You were at Stanford in 1970? Is that right?,,
,R," Yeah, I was a transfer student in 1970 and, um, the Chicano Movement was blossoming there as well. Um, the Chicanas and Chicanos at Stanford were, uh, building community and I had gotten a place to live at Escondido Village for families. Well, you couldn’t get into Escondido Village if you weren’t a family, and if you didn’t have a husband you we’re not a family. So I thought I just got into Escondido Village easily, you know? You applied, I got it. Uh uh. Last year, it was my 40th Anniversary at Stanford, I’ll tell you about that later. At Stanford. I went to speak to— I was invited to speak to the MeCHa students with a couple of other people— and the woman who I went with, she was the person that fought for single women to get into Stanford the year before I came. And so there’s a woman behind every movement that’s happening (laughs). And I’ll think of her name in a minute. Uh, she won the award last year for um— the Multicultural Award at Stanford. And she’s a judge and an attorney. And she has an amazing story. Well, I got to be on the MeCHa panel with her and two other people. And, I said I did not know it was because of you that I got into Escondido Village with my two daughters. They were raised there and that’s how I was able to go to school. Yeah. ",,
,I," Now, was this the time when— was there already Chicano— a Centro Chicano and a Casa Zapata, or was that yet to come?",,
,R," No, we— that’s yet to come. That’s what we did there. Yes. We started it. And, um, similar to what they were doing at San Diego State. And they called theirs Centro de Estudios—Estudio— am I saying it right?",,
,I, Yeah. Estudios Chicanos. ,,
,R," Centro de Estudios Chicanos. Yeah. Well, uh, they wanted it to be community-oriented at San Diego State. We were doing the same thing. We were trying to get a community-oriented program going. So we had MeCH— we didn’t meet— I was in MeCHa. I was a MeCHa student. But we did meet just in MeCHa. We met with MeCHa, the Chicano faculty, the Chicano staff. We were Chicano community. That’s what our meetings were called. They were called Chicano Community. And when we met it was a room full of people that were faculty, staff, and, uh, MeCHa students. So that was our organization. And, so, we—right away talked about issues. And I think I was invited because I was older. I was invited by Arturo Islas, Professor Arturo Islas, to be on the committee. It was called the Assistant to the President for Chicano Affairs. And what that was was, um, an advisory to the president of the university. We were the advisory to the president of the university. ‘Cause he had not a clue who Chicanos and Chicanas were so, yeah. ",,
,I," And there was a big push at that time to get more Chicano students at Stanford. So you were part of that wave, ‘cause I know it was in ’69-’70 and I think ’71 where the numbers just shot up. ",,
,R," Yes. Yes, its called recruitment. So we, we had to articulate what was important to us as a community as we sat in our circle. And we called it, um, recruitment of Chicano students, recruitment of Chicano faculty, and, uh, this was our dem— we had demands that we had. And, so, we wrote the demands down and this is what we wanted to be. We wanted to have more courses. Chi— uh, Arturo Islas probably taught the first course there, Chicano Literature and English. Um, I took his classes because I was an English major and, uh, I have to confess I fell in love (laughs). I was in love with Arturo Islas. ",,
,"I just thought sure that he was in love with me and that we were gonna get married (laughs). Oh, my gosh I remember, oh my gosh, I remember he invited us all over to dinner to his house. He was living in San Francisco, he wasn’t living in Palo Alto. And I said— and he said he had a roommate. He was living there with his roommate but when we went his roommate wasn’t there. And so, and my heart was pitter-pattering. Uh, when I said I thought he was in love with me, that’s a gross exaggeration. I was in love with him (laughs). And everyone was saying, “Rita you can meet someone again. You can fall in love again.” ",,,
,"‘Cause I said, “Well, I can’t ‘cause Catholics can’t get remarried.” And they said, “Everything’s changing.” So, I picked out Arturo to be my next husband (laughs). So, luckily, nothing happened ‘cause he already had love in his life. And he invited us to San Francisco to eat dinner one day and he— I said, “He said he had a roommate but there’s only one— he only has one bedroom and there’s only one little bed in the room.” And I was so naive, I didn’t know what was going on. But Arturo had had a, and it’s public knowledge now, and it's also in his archives, which I’ve studied  his archives. I cried through the whole thing because it’s a heartbreak. But he, uh, he did have a relationship and it was with another man, it wasn’t with another woman. And I was ready to find out who this other woman was and I was gonna go kick her butt (laughing) ‘cause I was in love with Arturo Islas. So that’s another heartbreak in my life. My second love was Arturo. ",,,
,"So, yes, he has a sad story because, um, yeah, he had lots of health problems even before he passed away in ’80. So, yeah. So I started right away at the Assistant to the President for Chicano Affairs. Thrown into it. The work’s there, you’ve gotta do the work, somebody’s gotta do it, and you’re the one to do it. That’s how you become an activist. ",,,
,I, And how long were you there at Stanford?,,
,R," I was actually there for four years because I got my Bachelor’s degree in two years because I was a transfer student and then we had Chicano graduation which was amazing. And I remember I was so moved by it. Everybody— we all gave our diplomas to our parents. We passed our diplomas to our parents. And I’m really happy that that happened. And, um, I had to get a job because I was— my husband that was no longer with me was a lawyer and had a job and I was not working. And now I had to figure out what to do and that’s why I went back to college. I wanted to get a job and I figured the best thing I could do was become a teacher. And I wanted to become a Spanish teacher but when it got into the course— the reading literature, I didn’t know what was going on. It was so difficult for me. I had to change my major. And because I loved literature, I changed it. Literature in those days was called English Literature until the movement. And then at Stanford I read Malcolm X. And, uh, I read, uh, Richard Wright and I read, uh, Ralph Ellison. And they were, you know, all the male authors. ",,
,"And there was a women’s movement too and I started reading Virginia Woolf. I started reading A Room of Your Own, I started reading all of the feminist literature and pretty soon, Chicano literature. And so, what I did is I entered a program called the Step Program at Stanford. And it's still alive and well if anyone wants to know about it. You get your Master’s Degree and your teaching credential all in a year. And you, uh, get, you can get the Master’s Degree in Education. Well, studying Education for me was like the secretarial course. My mind was the mind of a poet I couldn’t— I just couldn’t do it. So, I did get the Master’s Degree though and I did teach. I started student teaching and I started teaching, uh, English in a middle school. And it was very painful for me. It was very difficult. ‘Cause what I was basically doing was trying to help young teenagers. But my head was kind of in another place. So, I went back to Stanford another year and I got my Master’s Degree in the field so I could teach Literature. So I ended up with a Master’s Degree in Literature at Stanford. ",,,
,I," And you were there between, uh, ’70 and ’74.",,
,R," ’74, yeah. And all of this is, believe me, not just studying literature. This is the Civil Rights Movement. I mean, I remember moving barricades so that the military industrial complex, we used to call it (laughs), wouldn’t come in and give a speech to the students and try and recruit them into the war. And we put barricades up and I physically moved barricades. I mean, I’m sort of embarrassed to say this in front of my children but I actually graffitied walls and it was against the law to do that (laughing). And I was a mother with two children, so, uh, yeah. It was the Civil Rights Movement at it’s peak at Stanford. It was the women’s, um, the women’s— what is it? Tell me, somebody.",,
,I, Women’s Liberation?,,
,R, Yes. And the law that was passed in 197— ,,
,I, The ERA?,,
,R," The ERA in 1972. I was part of that. I was part of all those movements happening. And, uh, and then I had to get a job. And, so, what happened when I got my Master’s Degree is I was invited to, uh, teach at Cañada Community College. And, uh, so I did. So I started teaching there. And, uh, there was a guy there that stalked me a little bit. I say a little bit because I was terrified to go to work there. He was an ex, uh, prisoner. Ah, I’ve never talked about this before. And he saw me and then he started— I wouldn’t talk to him because I guess that’s how I was trained, you know, if some guy’s flirting with you just walk right on by, you know? So that’s what I did. And he— I guess I hurt his feelings— ‘cause he stalked me and he— at every time there was a meeting he started saying things about me without using my name. ",,
,"He started saying, “You know there are certain people that are teaching in this department that are stuck-up.” And then I found out that he was a pretty rough guy. That he was in there. ‘Cause we were a community at the— we called them “the pintos”. That  meant the people that were in prison too because it was by, uh, what’s that term that we used? We were called ‘political prisoners” and I included my own family in it because I thought, “No, they were imprisoned because they were unjustly arrested.” So that’s the mentality that we had. So that’s— we had higher consciousness in that respect but this guy I found out was, uh, a drug addict that had a— he was actually in there for murder. He killed his wife. ",,,
,"I don’t remember his name. That’s okay. I don’t want to but I was afraid to teach at Cañada College. I was afraid I’d run into him again. So, um, Alurista came into town. I was in a course— I was in a comparative literature course with a pro— his name was Professor Girard and I couldn’t believe, he came up to me and said, “You know, “ he said, “I’m having two poets come this week"," Ernesto Cardenal. Do you know who he is?”  Yeah. “Ernesto Cardenal and Alurista.” He said, “Would you mind picking up Alurista from the airport?” And I said, “Okay.” And that was a big deal for me ‘cause I didn’t drive a lot. I was kind of shy about that. But I had to go to the airport and pick up this guy called Alurista and that’s how I met Alurista. ",,
,I, And he was from San Diego. He was—,,
,R," And he was from San Diego. So, milagro number … what? What? Milagro number ten?",,
,I, (Laughs).,,
,R," (Laughs). Yeah, so, this miracle was meeting Alurista. He, uh, yes. I said, “You know I’m just looking for a job right now. I’m graduating, uh, this year with my Master’s in English and I have to find a job.” And he said, “Well, I know about a job.” And he told me the whole story about what was going on in San Diego. He said, “Oh my gosh there’s a big upheaval going on in San Diego right now.” And he said, “And we’re all leaving ‘cause we wanted to form the Cen— keep going with the Centro de Estudios but they are forming the, uh, either the College of Professional Studies or College of Arts and Letters and the college, you have to be either part of a department and then a college and you have to get your PhD.” And I said, “Oh my gosh, I’ve got two children. I can’t do that.” And he said, “Well, you should go down and look into it and everything.” He said, “Right now they’re trying to find people. And you’re teaching English. They probably need an English teacher.” ",,
,"So, I came to San Diego because of Alurista. And it was in the middle of upheaval because the people that had been there before were now moving on. Some of them because they didn’t like the way that we— they—were being forced to go into a department the way they were. Without much dialogue, probably. And, so, um, I was interviewed by, his name was Roberto Cerros, that was hired to take over the hiring of Chicanos coming to San Diego State. And, coincidentally, Richard had been teaching at, uh, Cal— at the beach up north almost all the way to San Francisco— the beach there. The university there. Richard was—.",,,
,I, Santa Cruz?,,
,R," No. Uh, north. He was teaching— no. It wasn’t Santa Cruz. I’ll think of the name of it in a minute. Um, by Monterey. ",,
,I," Um, I think Monterey Bay started later. ",,
,R," Yeah, we’ll think of it. It’ll pop, click in. He was a professor there and he did not, as a Chicano professor, he did not receive tenure. And he took it to court. It was a lawsuit. So he had—Richard had to find another job. And, so, Richard applied to San Diego State. He was married. Um, um, I applied at the same time. I was hired as an English teacher, he was hired as a History teacher. As a History professor. And he already had his PhD. So. ",,
,"I was hired and I had to apply for the PhD program. So, I applied at UCSD and thank God I was accepted. So, I was at UCSD and I said this yesterday when you were taping"," I was a full-time mom, a full-time professor at San Diego State, and a full-time student at UCSD. And I think that’s just what they expected all Chicanas to do. “Hey. You’ve gotta take care of the kids, that’s your job. And you know what? You’ve got a full time job? Well you have to get your PhD. Or you’ve got your PhD? You’ve got to get a full time job.” You know? That we’re expected to do it all is ridiculous. Ugh.  ",,
,I," So, we were still— we were just talking about Stanford and I wanted to ask you about, uh, you know, you had been mentioning that there was the Women’s Movement and you took the Women’s Studies classes and there was the Chicano Movement and so I wanted to ask you about the intersections between the two and, um, your discovery of that particular— the contradictions of being Chicana in the Chicano Movement and the contradictions of being a Chicana woman in the Women’s Movement. ",,
,R, Yeah. ,,
,I, What was that experience like for you?,,
,R," Oh my gosh, it’s, it’s very compartmentalized. ‘Cause you said the interconnections and there weren’t any interconnections. I didn’t see any interconnections at all. So the Chicana Feminist Movement for me is with Chicanas. It wasn’t— I got knowledge and I learned something from my readings of literature of women, American women, but ne’er the twain shall meet at Stanford. So when I proposed to teach the course there for women, it was Chicanas and what it was is I knew that young Chicanas were coming in that had never been away from home. I knew they were needing to learn to write. That’s the most important thing. So everything for me was about helping these young Chicanas write and read and write so they could pass and grow on and undertake the great demands of education. And try to be committed to it. So, yes, everything about my involvement was a Chicana experience. Yeah. ",,
,"I— there were women that befriended me and I really am so grateful to those women because to me those were the courageous ones. They were the ones who stepped apart, like my friend Judy in high school, the Catholic Jewish girl I was telling you about. Then at college there were women that befriended me and they invited me to Massachusetts and, sadly, I didn’t go. ‘Cause I was very isolated in the sense of being not able to travel because I had two children. I wasn’t courageous in that way. That’s one way that I wasn’t courageous is through traveling. ",,,
,"But I did have women that invited me to go. And, uh, one couple that I liked at Stanford— it was in the literature department— invited me to come to Massachusetts, Cambridge. They said, “I asked Mary what she wanted for Christmas, or, what she wanted for her birthday and she wants you to come to Cambridge.” And I didn’t do any of that. So. I was pretty— once the Chicano experience started for me, my friends felt kind of abandoned, my anglo friends. They felt like, well, we’re part of the movement too. How come you haven’t called us? But, it was busy, busy, hard work. ",,,
,"Yeah. I remember Cristieta and I working into the night writing press releases and meeting the press and going to meetings. And this is like the fourth job. I mean, you have two or three other jobs. And it was hard, hard, hard work. And, uh, so what we did as a committee, we were the Assistant to the President for Chicano Affairs, and as you know, Cecilia Burciaga, who came later, that was her very title. We— one of our demands that we wanted to hire a woman called the Assistant to the President for Chicano Affairs and then our committee would diminish a little bit. And so that’s what we did ‘cause we used to meet all the time. So we interviewed all these women and Cecilia Burciaga was one of them. And then, uh, we met, we all went to San Francisco and I don’t remember if it was to meet Cecilia or to pick her up from the airport or whatever it was. I can’t remember what that was. ",,,
,"But while the women were there I found out that I had a lump in my breast and I… I had to go to the doctor. And it was on the very same day we were supposed to go to San Francisco for some reason. I think it was to meet Cecilia for some reason. Um, I can’t remember what it was. But my friend Teresa Guerrero stayed and went to the doctor with me while I had surgery ‘cause they didn’t know what was gonna happen and they took it out and showed it to me and it was the weirdest conglomeration of lumps you ever saw in your life and I think it’s— I’m not sure what it was but they took it out and they said it wasn’t— it was benign. It wasn’t cancerous. It wasn’t a malignant tumor. So, that was one of the experiences I had. ",,,
,"When they came home, they had had their picture taken and blown up to a big picture like that and I’m not in it (laughs). I said, “I should have changed my appointment day!” Because that picture became famous and I’m not in it. And when Judy, uh, Judith Baca was going to Stanford to paint a mural she said she was going to Photoshop me in and I don’t think it’s happened yet (laughs). But anyway, that’s the story of that. And so we, our committee, hired Cecilia Burciaga. So. That’s what we did. Yeah. ",,,
,I," And, uh, was Casa Zapata already there or did you—?",,
,R," No, no. Casa Zapata was not there. Everything was kind of happening at the same time. Kind of like, uh, contractions piling up on one another. And, so, my friend Teresa Guerrero told me about her brother, Sarco, and he was in the Tepoztlán and Teopztlán’s a pretty interesting arts community and so she told me all about his work and she told me that he was sculpting and that he has found a foundry in Tepoztlán that was actually, uh, doing the bronze. It’s hot bronze they put over the sculpting. Then it hardens and dries and that’s the sculpture piece. And, so, he was actually— I met him— and he was actually sculpting at my house. And you know, all this plaster and clay was all over the place and he did “Wounded Knee” on the side of my house. That’s one of his famous sculptures. ",,
,"And, uh, we were also doing programs. He was constantly innovative ‘cause we wanted to hire a resident artist, we called it. And the resident artist would be there to promote events and do the art and he would be paid and he would get a stipend and that sort of thing. That was Sarco. Yeah. ",,,
,"And, just to tell you a little bit about the mural, he painted a famous mural at— and I was part of the development of that mural— that went up in Stanford that became very controversial. And then he wanted me to be the indigenous woman. ‘Cause he had the indigenous woman. Luckily it wasn’t the old, old woman. The old, old woman was really, probably my age now. Very wrinkled and just an Indian woman who was really really old. And the middle woman was a blonde woman with beautiful hair but no face. And that was why it was controversial because people began to identify with that. “Well, I’m a blonde and how come they have me up there with no face?” And, so, the mural became very, very controversial. But he ch— he used somebody else to do the mural. And he said somebody talked him out of it. So, anyway, I just wanted everybody to know I was invited to be the indigenous woman and it never happened (laughing). So. ",,,
,I," And at that time you also produced this important, uh, collection of writing called Imágines de la Mujer and I don’t know if you can share with us a little bit about that process.",,
,R," Yeah. Okay. Once again it’s about Antonia. Antonia had already taught a course. She had taught the first Chicana course, I’m pretty sure. We’ll have to look that up. Somebody said, you know when I went to Stanford, they said, “It doesn’t matter who’s first.” And I said, “No, it doesn’t, but I think it’s important to know that certain women like Antonia were doing innovative things and it took a lot of courage. That’s what’s important.” And, uh, so that Sonia Lopez taught the first Chicano course at San Diego State is really important because who had the courage and innovative knowledge to do that at that particular time? It seems logical today but, no. You’re in the middle of it. You’re not. It’s a new idea.",,
,"So, Antonia had taught the course. A book had come out called Literatura Chicana and it’s just a collage of different things. It’s not literature Chicana. It’s called Literatura Chicana because I think the “a” rhymes with—jives with “literatura” is the only reason. But it’s lots of things in there. And she and Tomás Ybarra Frausto were the first ones to publish anything that looked like a book to us. We had never seen a book that was a Chicano/Chicana book. And that was so important to me. When she told me that her name was on that book and I saw her picture I was just amazed. I was like, “You’re on a book? That is so amazing!” And it was Professor Joseph Summers that had encouraged it and helped them and they got it published and everything. ",,,
,"Well, I decided that we needed to publish, you know? We should publish! And, so, that was my big thing was publish. And for a reason ‘cause none of us had seen any of our race, our culture, our people, our friends in publications. Or even a hispano name. Except a Spanish book in a Spanish class or something. And so, so I deci— oh! There, there was a fellowship. I was now becoming a graduate student and there was a fellowship called the Chicano Fellows Program. And there— it had been going on for four years and they chose four people each year and every year there were four guys. So, four years, four guys, that’s sixteen guys, right? And I thought, “Hey! What’s wrong with us? Are we chopped liver?” (Laughs).",,,
," And, so, I started thinking about it and then it was time to apply and I just applied. I applied for the fellowship. And I proposed teaching a Chicana course for women. I mean, a course for women so that we could learn more about ourselves in the middle of this movement. And, oh! That was a pretty good idea. And of course I was taking all these feminist literature courses in the literature and listening to people like Antonia and women really working hard on conferences that were going to go to Mexico City, that were going to Denver, that were going to other places, and I couldn’t go. I had two children. ",,,
,"So, so that’s, that’s kinda what happened. So, I proposed the course and then I had to go speak about it and, so, I got the fellowship for— so they used to call me the “Chicana Fella” (laughs). So I got that fellowship and started teaching the course. And then during the course I wanted to publish so I started collecting all the chicana writings. And there had been a— so now my next thing to do— oh! To propose the course I had to also propose the course to the English Department. I had to ask for this course because I couldn’t just ask the Fellowship Program for it. I had to ask the English Department if I could teach a course for women in the English Department. So, I first spoke to my professor about it. His name was Professor Chase, I remember. And he said, “Look, you know, you’re applying for this fellowship and the course is needed and they’re gonna like you. I don’t see any problem with it.” That’s Stanford. I always tell everybody. Oh my God, it was heaven in that way because they were always really wanting to support you. There was none of this, “Hmm. Let’s see, no.” ",,,
,"You know? I get that at San Diego State right now and I get really mad ‘cause I never used to get that at Stanford. They always wanted to be at the front of innovation at Stanford and that was the difference I think. So, I proposed it, they said, “Yes.” And I said, “Well, look. There’s incoming freshmen, too, and they could use a course. Their first language isn’t English and they could use a course, too.” So I ended up teaching English to the incoming transfer and freshman students, whoever wanted to take the course, and the course for Chicana students, uh, Chicana women. So, I just went to class and I thought, “Oh my God, what am I doing? How can I do this?” And so I just told them my idea that I wanted their— asked to see their works and writings. “I don’t even care if you can do it or if you’re professional. We’ll just do it and then we’ll just see our names in writing.” So that was the idea.",,,
,"And, so, we got a few research papers, um, different things that students did in the classes. And, um, my next thing was to propose it, right? To propose the journal. And I knew they were going to say “yes” to it. They had the money. They could afford it. And a student there, he’s from the Imperial Valley and I can’t remember his name, he had started a journal called… I can’t remember the name of it. It’ll come in in a minute. Not Iscali, ‘cause that’s just in my head. It’s Mexitli or something. ",,,
,I, Mexitli.,,
,R," He was a really neat guy. He had started a journal, they had published poems and different things in it. So, he kinda got the leg work and everything going’. The busy work for it to get it going. Women turned in their papers, they got together. I edited everything. I had to read every single thing and fix it to be publishable. And then I had written an essay because, now I’m trying to remember if this is true or not, um, I had written an essay because I had been invited— as an English teacher I was always getting invited to speak at different places. This comes later. This comes for this journal, I think. I think the story I’m telling comes for this journal. This journal is Imagines and let me see what— I can’t remember his name— what his name was. Where is my name in here? ",,
,"Anyway, I wrote the introductory essay and I was the editor of the journal but they didn’t, I don’t think they really called it that. I can’t remember what they called it. It was this journal that, um, I was invited to speak at a conference. Oh, um, after this was published we didn’t even realize what we were doing. We just thought, “We want to see our names. We should be published. Our work is important. We don’t want to just see our names but we want to see our work in print too so other people can read it.” And so that was my whole drive as a student at Stanford was to write and publish. If it wasn’t perfect, that was okay. We’re still gonna do it anyway. There’s a million books published and we want to see our names published as well. ",,,
,"And, so, I taught that course that— the Chicana course and then at the end of the year I went to, I met Alurista and I went to apply for the job at San Diego State and I got the job at San Diego State. And then I knew all of these women had been there before so I thought, “Well, what am I gonna do? I’m just here by myself. What am I gonna do?” And so I just decided to do what I’d already done at Stanford. I’d teach the course, um, I would— I invited a woman called Suni Paz, she was from Argentina, she was a revolutionary woman. And she wrote songs of struggle and revolution. And one of her albums was called “brotando del silencio” so, so that’s what I did. I was invited to give a talk at San Jose State University, uh, as a Chicana writer and I wasn’t even published or anything. But they had all these women from, uh, Latin America that were published poets. And I didn’t fit into that category. What was I gonna talk about?",,,
,"So the title of my talk was “brotando del silencio” it was chicana writer breaking out of silence. And so, Tillie Olsen, um, let me just tell this story. Maybe it doesn’t quite fit but I want to tell it because it’s really important to me. Tillie Olsen is a famous thirties writer. She’s a really famous writer of the thirties which is about class struggle in the United States and she was the keynote speaker. And she said, “You know what? I don’t believe in one person being a keynote speaker. I want to invite someone up here with me.” And she had heard my talk at lunch or something and she invited me to come up there with her. And I was just shocked because I thought, “Oh my God I’m nobody! I haven’t written anything I haven’t published anything. This is the Latin American Literature Conference and all of these people are published poets, authors, and writers from Latin America!” Like, uh… Graci— I was gonna throw out some names to you but, uh, I’ll think of ‘em in a minute. ",,,
,"So, I was embarrassed but I just got up there and said what I said in my talk and that’s all. And then I was walking— I’ve only told one person this story before but I’m gonna tell you guys on this tape— I was walking along at San Jose State and there were a group of women and one of the women— I was walking by, or not walking by, I was behind them and one of the women said, “Well what did they invite her for?” And I heard that and I just shriveled up. And there was nothing I could do about it. I just kept walking and I just— and then they had to see me, right? And they saw that I was the woman they were talking about. So I just kept walking and I just thought, “Oh my God I’m so embarrassed. How could Tillie Olsen have invited me up here to talk with her?” (Laughs) And now I’m hearing a couple of women say why did they invite her up there and, and they were Chicanas. And I just froze. So, um, I kept going with my theme and when it was time they told us they wanted to publish some of the writers that had been at the Latin American Writers’ Conference. And I said, “Okay.” So I just got it ready, put the title on there Brotando del silencio and changed it a little bit and gave it to them and that’s the essay that’s kind of followed me around for my whole life. Because people were thinking about that but somebody just said, “We need to be published! We need to write too! And writing’s important to us!” ",,,
,"In fact, when we write, uh, it’s important because somebody else is gonna read it and then somebody else is gonna get an idea and then somebody else is gonna pass it on to somebody else and it’s gonna be a chain reaction and pretty soon we’ll all be writing and everything’ll be published. So that was my essay, um, that I wrote. Brotando del silencio and that’s how I came about. So. ",,,
,I," Well, I wanna say very quickly that it’s true, though, because now we have this thing that we call Chicana Feminist Literature and Cultural Studies and there is a huge industry of work. ",,
,R, {Laughs),,
,I," We have, you know, University of Texas Press, uh, has this Chicana Matters series.",,
,R, Yeah that’s Antonia. ,,
,I," Yeah, so—.",,
,R," Well, you know, just, uh, if I can finish with this... ",,
,I, Yes.,,
,R," When I got to San Diego State and I w— and I said I want to keep doing what the Chicanas here were doing. They were fighting for their rights as well. And I said I wanna keep doing that. So I decided to do what we did at Stanford and to do the journal. And, so, when it came time to—oh, hmm. Yeah. When it came time to write the introduction, for the title of this book I chose the title of Antonia Acastañada’s first course as a tribute to Antonia Castañada and I told her about it ‘cause her first course was called “Visión de la mujer de la raza.” And I just loved that title ‘cause it had a ring to it and I said, “That’s what I’m gonna call the book. Visión de la mujer de la raza.” But it was long so we just ended up putting “Visión.”But I think in here, in the introduction, I told what that was about. ",,
,"And then I thought this up and I’ve used this at the Mesa College Mural, too. It says, “A vision is not a dream. It’s a reality that already exists but it’s only waiting to be realized.” So that was my big quote that I used and then we used in on a mural at Mesa College and then the essay that I wrote for this book was taken from the same one I’d written at Stanford. And I said, “Well, it’s the same essay and I’ve just changed it a little bit.” And then one of the women said, “Well, why don’t you call it what you talk about in your paper?” ‘Cause in the paper I called it “Writing is a Revolutionary Act.” ‘Cause I always felt like I had the little voice, you know? And if you’re an activist you’re supposed to have a loud voice. But a revolutionary can speak by writing as well. So I called it “Writing is a Revolutionary Act” and that’s how it came out to be. ",,,
,"And Gail Perez, my friend, she got teacher of the year this year at USD. She said, “Rita, everywhere I go, so many women quote your essay"," ‘Writing is a Revolutionary Act’ from Brotando del Silencio.” So, that was a gift. A big one. And another milagro. ",,
,R," So, you mentioned you wanted to say one thing about Dorinda that you, uh.",,
,I," You know, it kind of connects, I suppose. But, um, my daughters were with me. I had two young daughters as I said, Lisa— she’s Lisa LaRosa now and Teana Osquera ( Tape 12 0","49). They were with me, as a student. So, these young girls were becoming conscious as they traveled with me day-to-day on the campus and everywhere. And there were two things, I’m not sure if they were the first. I wanted to say something about Dorinda Moreno. I went to a— as a freshman at Stanford I went— I wasn’t a freshman. As a first year student at Stanford there I went to a program that they had at the Cubberley Auditorium and this woman gets up and she is this majorly outstanding, formidable-looking, tall, woman and she’s gonna tell us the three voices of Chicanas growing up. ",
,,,,
,"One of them was the grandmother and she gave this lulling sound of her grandmother and how she rocked her. ‘Ra-u. Ru, ru, ru’ and this voice just rippling through. And it just takes you into memory and you’re just not even in the room anymore. And then she also started talking about the voices of justice. And she, she got— she had something like a washboard or something where she ran this, uh, metal over the washboard to sound like bars of Salt of the Earth. Then it— “queremos justicia, queremos justice, queremos formula” for the baby. And she rings out her voice on that. And then she screams out this grito of the crying woman, la Llorona, uh, la mujer gritando. And it’s just going right straight through you and you’re identifying with it like nobody ever understood you before and now somebody does, you know? ‘Cause you’re that woman. ",,,
,"So, my daughters were introduced to all of this. They were introduced to Dorinda when she invited myself and my daughters to meet Sacheen Littlefeather because Sacheen Littlefeather was ridiculed at the Academy Awards for what she said in protesting against all the films that have done injustice against American Indians. Well, the Academy Awards just laughed at her when she did that. But we sat in a circle with her in San Francisco and my children were there. They were so moved by that. And they’re these little kids and you’re not even thinking about them. You’re just into the program. And Sacheen Littlefeather is teaching us a song of the Indian woman. I’m trying to think… a chant. She says, “Okay I’m gonna teach everybody a chant.” And it’s, “ Hi, hi, malaya, himalaya, himalay chin chai-o.” She goes around the room and she does it about five times and my children are there and, uh, I don’t know if I said that right but something like that and they were so affected. ",,,
,"When I came home, they had in their journals written out the whole poem that she had— I couldn’t remember it— but they had written out the whole poem. They had written their art. The youth are so valuable because they’re gonna carry on what they hear and take it and pass it on to the next generation when we’re no longer here. And, um, so, to answer your question, though, about the art, and moving to San Diego, um, we, we also, when we did the Visión Journal in San Diego, my children were also beside me. So when we did any kind of a march for Cesár Chavez and the farmworkers, they just happened to be there because I didn’t have a babysitter. They were just like an appendage (laughs). And, so, they were very affected by the movement. And, so, then when I got to San Diego State, I was a single mom, as I said. And the first thing that I walked into when I came to San Diego was a mural and when I saw it my heart stopped because murals were happening in San Francisco. And the art was everywhere and so important. Poetry and music and oh my gosh I heard so many artists and so many poets I can— um. One of them, a woman that I really admire, um, “Refugee Ship” is the title of her poem that I use in my class every semester because her poem is so meaningful to the students. Like we feel like a refugee ship, just without a doc. And if I don’t remember her name I’m gonna be really upset. I’m gonna remember in a minute. She was one of the Chicana poets that affected me in San Francisco. ",,,
,"So I really missed that when I came to San Diego and I, um, my student— my children were always with me and the first thing we saw when we came to San Diego was a mural. And, so, it was very touching. I thought, “I need to find these people.” And that was, uh, Mario Torero’s mural and it was, uh, I believe it was a woman with outstretched arms. And it was a community mural and all inside all their names were signed on there. And I thought, “I’ve gotta find these people.” And so I think that was my introduction to the arts. Although it didn’t start there with Mario it started— since I was a child the arts were really important to me. And that’s the one thing I did besides read was draw. ‘Cause that’s what I did, you know? When it’s quiet, there’s no TV, you just— my mother gave us a piece of paper and I remember it was butcher paper. She didn’t buy any typing paper. It was butcher paper. She saved all the butcher papers in a little stack and then gave it to us. And we drew pictures on the butcher paper. ",,,
,"So, it goes back a long way. But when I saw the art I was really moved because the image was so beautiful. And it was in, uh, of all places Grossmont Shopping Center and, uh, so I eventually met the artist. I met— because I had to go into the PhD program at UCSD I met Alurista because we were all in the PhD program. I was the only one in the English Department. Everybody else was in the Spanish Department but we all met so we could create community together and continue talking so we could get through. We’d meet about once a week and have dinner. And mostly it was at Alurista’s because he had small children so we met there. And, um, one day he, uh, Mario was there. So I met Mario. Well, that— I would have just gone home and nothing would have ever happened, but— this guy you know, he’s just right on top of it. You know, call and, “Oh,” you know, “who are you?” and that sort of thing, you know, calling right away. And so that’s how I met the artist and got involved with the arts. ",,,
,"His father, Mario Torero Acevedo’s father, was a beautiful artist that had come from Peru and that had been painting in Peru and he came to San Diego and he was an artist. And his son, now, is an artist. And they were doing activist things in the community. All these guys. And they’d come over to the house, make a lot of noise, and I didn’t really like that. ‘Cause to me, that was my refuge. My only refuge. And, so, he was mad ‘cause I was disrespectful to all these guys and, so, well, anyway. It started out rough. ",,,
,"And so, um, we eventually— to get right to the story— we eventually, we almost didn’t but we did get married. And I have two beautiful children, Lucía and Pablo. Pablo was born on Chicano Park Day! I don’t know! There’s more than one miracle in the world (laughing) he was born on April 22nd, 1980. And I was a student at UCSD. I went until the very last day and that was the last day I ever went back to UCSD. I had two babies. I had Lucía and Pablo now and, so, I finished all my coursework, I finished my language requirement, uh, and with the help of Antonio and Arturo, her husband, we— I was on a Ford Foundation Fellowship— so I was able to do it and then I had my baby right the day before my last day of class. And, uh, he was born the next day. Chicano Park Day. The summer. ",,,
,"And I went back to teaching as much as I could and then they said, “You have to finish your dissertation.” And I got half of it done but I didn’t do all of it. And it's uh, my dissertation is, uh, Chicano Literature. It’s in Chicano Literature and it’s called, uh, Utopianism in Chicano Literature. And utopianism is connected to class struggle and, and, a really popular trend in that period— Marxist literature. But it’s mostly about class struggle and people’s desire for a better world and for justice. And, so, that’s what I started writing my dissertation on. But my last day was that day. I was very involved in the arts because of Mario’s family and I give all credit to them for opening up an art gallery. ",,,
,"Once I— they gave me a terminal year at San Diego State. They said,  “You have to have your dissertation finished. Remember when you came here you had to have a PhD.” And, so, without much support, much mentoring, I was able to study but, um, without that mentoring I did not finish the PhD. And of course I had the pregnancies and the children and the full-time job. And they all wanted me there full-time. So, um, I took the terminal year and didn’t go back. I taught my last year at San Diego State, about three years after my son was born in 1980. Uh, Pablo. And, Lucia was my first born and she had her son yesterday. Little Logan Gonzales was born yesterday. ",,,
,"But, um, they were so much a part of the movement with me. All of them. Pablo’s an artist, a poet, uh, Lucía was very involved. She had Chunky at the school and introduced him to all of his students. The arts were just drenched in our lives. Every party we had for the kids was about art. It was either a huge parade in the streets as they recall it or— I worked for Young at Art, the time that I was off, now, not teaching now, I didn’t have a job. I am not teaching now. So I, um, applied for the arts, um, programs in San Diego. ",,,
,"Actually, Mario got the commissioner’s job. Artist commissioners. It’s an appointment. I applied for it too. I thought, “Well, he’s applying. I’m going to apply too!” And, well, he got it. He’s the artist so I’m glad he got it. And then they had a grant that was given to the arts community called The Muriel Gluck Foundation. And she wanted artists to teach in the schools. She did not want teachers trying to be artists. She said she was gonna pay for artists to come into the school and teach. And we were sort of an amazing group of people. And by nature, by employment I was not an artist. I wasn’t. But I had grown up being an artist, you know, writing on the butcher paper (laughs). And, uh, and my family knew I was that way. ",,,
,"And, so, I applied for the Young at Art arts program, teachers teaching art in the schools, and I got one of the positions. So we worked so amazingly. I made a mural. It was called the, um, Rainforest Mural that I painted with the students at Old Town Elementary School. And I made birds with them. Rainforest birds out of paper maché and then we grounded them into chunks of wood so they could stand up with, you know, coat hanger legs. And then we painted them. We made books, uh, we made fabrigé eggs. We, we just did some amazing things. And then I had an exhibit with Tia Matel, (5","08 Tape 13 check spelling) she’s the artist that was in the Young at Arts Program. She and I together— I proposed it to her, actually, asked her if she wanted to do it with me— we had our own exhibit of the work that we had done. Our work was shown in the San Diego Museum of Art. Not just mine and her’s but other artists’ as well. ",,
,"Um, Mario was working with the guys in the park and that was what they did. All the guys would go and they’d hang out together. And from me he learned there’s other ways and other things to do. And he tried to implement the women into his art and artwork. So, he painted a Frida Kahlo— he proposed doing a Frida Kahlo in the art. So the Chicano Art has Frida Kahlo. He painted the Virgen of Guadalupe in the park and he asked me to be the model. And I was expecting my daughter Lucia that had the baby yesterday. And so, I was pretty drenched in the arts and very committed to the arts. And I tried to buy art from artists. And when I saw that his employment as an artist was very precarious, I proposed that we get a spot for him to show his art. So, we found one in a district of town that’s not downtown and its, its called Mission Hills. And its where people come to sort of buy art. So we had it there. ",,,
,"Uh, KPBS wanted to hear about it, so we did a presentation on KPBS. The arts was just— filled our lives. Every moment, every day. It was very rich. And, you know, with all the faults and struggles we had in our marriage, uh, he’s a lover of life. He loves life, he loves art. The two go together. Our children were affected. They still are. And so, that’s— I eventually said, I, “I have a lot of trouble with you just scrambling in the streets to make a living when you’re such a dedicated artist. Why don’t we open up an art gallery?”",,,
,"So, um, as I said, giving full credit to his father and himself, we opened up the Acevedo— we said, “What should we call it? Well, let’s just call it the Acevedo Gallery.” ‘Cause they had a gallery before and that’s what it was called. So we called it the Acevedo gallery. We were there for 8 years. And I was the one in charge of finances and the direction and everything about a business. Reading about how to grow a business. And, uh, in that way it was extremely successful. We made money off the gallery to live. Only— it’s not easy it takes persistence. You never leave, you never give up, you never stop doing your work, you find out why something isn’t working. If it’s a business you have to see about it. Community was invited in. I made sure my friends were introduced to the arts. Uh, Maria Garcia and Rosalia Selinez, they thank me forever that I made them buy some Zúñiga art. I said, “You have to buy it! I know it’s expensive but if you don’t buy it it’s gonna be worth $20,000 and you wont have it! And you could get it right now for $2,000!” (Laughs) And they just thank me forever ‘cause it came true of course. And they have beautiful art in their homes. They love art.",,,
,"And, um, we had a lot of artists. We had artists from Oaxaca, other parts of Mexico, we’ve had Chicano artists, I made sure we had women artists. I flew in art from New York from women artists. Um, I found out who the Chicana artists were, I invited them in from San Francisco. It was an amazing period of life for me. And I’m very thankful that I was able to be a part of that world. I’ve met all the artists. I’ve met every single Chicano artist that are now famous. The biggest one I think of is Carlos Almaraz, Judith Hernandez, Barbara Carrasco. Uh, you know, I feel really blessed to have met all of these artists. Carlos Almaraz showed at our exhibit that we had here. Mario opened a little gallery that we had before we opened Acevedo Gallery that stayed for a little while. It was called SolArt and, uh, he, um, yes. So there was a lot of art activity. ",,,
,"And Judith Hernandez showed in that exhibit. Um, my friend Isabel Alerdilla(10","09 Tape 13) bought art from the gallery. Some women could afford it and others couldn’t. As I say, they’re forever grateful for it. And I saw Dionne paying a lot of money for an art piece the other night and I told her, “This is one thing in your life you’ll never forget"," buying a work of art.” So I really feel blessed by Guillermo Acevedo and Lydia Acevedo, Mario’s parents, and Mario. And, uh, um, so, and thankful that I could be so involved in the arts. I’ve been in so many parades, I’ve made so much art with children. I made a huge sun, sol, that we carried in a parade. Just— it’s a very blessed— uh, sadly, that was my second marriage, you know. And we were married for twelve years, and, uh, we broke up in, uh, see! I forgot the year! So no wonder I’m divorced (laughs)! ",
,"I forgot the year. But, uh, yeah so I was on my own for five years. I decided I wasn’t ever gonna go out there again with anybody and start any kind of a relationship. And it was a really, really hard time again for me. I had two more children and I couldn’t believe that this was happening to me for a second time in my life and, uh, I kept working and I thank Irma Castro ‘cause she started an organization— women are always there when you’re miserable and you need somebody! Nobody else is but women are. ",,,
,"And Irma Castro started a program called Niñas de Aztlán and she said, “You know what? We’re waiting too long. We’re waiting until kids are in college to try to train them to be Chicanas. We need to start sooner.” So she started an organization called Niñas de Aztlán. And I put some pictures over there on the table of the event. I became a mentor for Niñas de Aztlán. And that’s how I came out of depression and sadness of a family break-up. And, uh, I just kept going. And there were more women that entered in the picture that became part of my life and, uh, for five years I really worked hard on the program I was in. ",,,
,"I had been teaching Chicana Studies since 19— uh, two— 1973. So this year’s the 40th anniversary. So that’s how long I’ve been teaching the Chicana course. So I think it’s the longest running Chicana course that’s ever happened (laughing). And so they’re saying, you know, “When is she gonna leave?” (Laughs) You know, Mesa College. ‘Cause they had probably wanted some new person to come and take over but, anyway, I retired last year and I, uh, started doing more and more genealogy and writing and publishing my genealogy work. The First Chicano Mestizos. That was one of ‘em. And, uh, I got involved with Reality Changers. It’s a program kind of like Linda and Carlos LeGerrette’s Chavista’s Club except it doesn’t have that theme of core values that they use or César Chávez but it does have core values as a theme. So, I’ve been involved in that. ",,,
,"And, so, I was also invited by Paul Espinoza to be on the board of the Chunky Sanchez, uh, it’s called Rising Souls. Uh, a film that he’s trying to produce. He’s been working on this for a while. So I’m grateful to be on the advisory committee. And, uh, we’ve met and it’s good and they had a huge production! Almost like the ones you have here of the Los Lobos in my house when they came to town. Chunky and— was with Los Lobos about three or four months ago and they set up in here to interview, uh, interview the Los Lobos about Chunky. They had to move all the furniture out and cover up the windows with black and it was like a stage in here! But they’re beautiful people. They’re always thinking and working and trying to produce something good. Uh, Martha Sanchez and Paul Espinoza. So, uh, life is very, very good. I was with my newborn grandson last night. Logan Gonzales. And Lucía and Eric are amazing too. And I’m just thankful to everybody.",,,
